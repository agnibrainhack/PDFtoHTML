<h3>Additional Commentary – Variance Analysis
</h3>
<p>26</p>
<p>The following summary provides selected variance information for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. It <br>should be read in conjunction with the statistical tables for Q4'23, available at ir.americanexpress.com.</p>
<ul>
<li> Discount Revenue: Increased 5 percent versus Q4'22, primarily driven by an increase in billed business.
</li>
<li> Net Card Fees: Increased 17 percent versus Q4'22, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios. <br>▪ Service Fees and Other Revenue: Increased 10 percent versus Q4'22, primarily driven by higher travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel 

<br>business, foreign exchange related revenues associated with Card Member cross-currency spending and growth in delinquency fees. 
</li>
<li> Processed Revenue: Decreased 3 percent versus Q4'22, primarily driven by a decrease in volumes associated with the decommission of one of our alte rnative <br>payment solutions.
</li>
<li> Interest Income: Increased 40 percent versus Q4'22, primarily driven by higher interest rates and growth in revolving loan balances.
</li>
<li> Interest Expense: Increased 61 percent versus Q4'22, primarily driven by higher interest rates paid on customer deposits.
</li>
<li> Provisions for Credit Losses: Increased 40 percent versus Q4'22, primarily driven by higher net write offs, partially offset by a lower net reserve build in the <br>current period. 
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Additional Commentary – Variance Analysis
</h4>
<p>27</p>
<ul>
<li> Card Member Rewards Expense: Increased 3 percent versus Q4'22, primarily driven by increases in cobrand rewards and Membership Rewards expenses, all <br>of which were primarily driven by higher billed business, partially offset by lower redemption costs.

</li>
<li> Business  Development Expense:  Increased  14  percent  versus  Q4'22,  primarily due to  increased  partner  payments  driven  by higher  contractual  rates  and <br>network volumes.
</li>
<li> Card Member Services Expense: Increased 21 percent versus Q4'22, primarily due to higher usage of travel-related benefits.
</li>
<li> Marketing Expense: Decreased 4 percent versus Q4'22, reflecting lower levels of spending on customer acquisitions.
</li>
<li> Salaries and Employee Benefits: Increased 5 percent versus Q4'22, primarily driven by higher compensation costs.
</li>
<li> Other Expenses: Increased 2 percent versus Q4'22, primarily driven by foreign exchange losses related to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, a reserve <br>associated with a merchant exposure for Card Member purchases, a FDIC special assessment, and a contribution to the American Express Foundation, all of 
<br>which were partially offset by lower losses on Amex Ventures investments.

<p>This presentation includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and </p>
<p>uncertainties.  The forward-looking statements, which address American Express Company’s current expectations regarding business and financial performance, </p>
<p>including management’s outlook for 2024 and long-term growth aspiration, among other matters, contain words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” <br>“plan,” “aim,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “likely,” “continue” and similar expressions.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these 
</p>
<p>forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.  The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-<br>looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul><li> the company’s ability to achieve its 2024 earnings per common share (EPS) outlook and grow EPS in the future consistent with the company’s growth <br>aspiration, which will depend in part on revenue growth, credit performance and the effective tax rate remaining consistent with current expectations and the 
<br>company’s ability to continue investing at high levels in areas that can drive sustainable growth (including its brand, value propositions, customers, 

<br>colleagues, marketing, technology and coverage), controlling operating expenses, effectively managing risk and executing its share repurchase program, 
<br>any of which could be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified in the subsequent paragraphs as well as the following: macroeconomic 

<br>conditions, such as recession risks, changes in interest rates, effects of inflation, labor shortages and strikes or higher rates of unemployment, supply chain 
<br>issues, energy costs and fiscal and monetary policies; geopolitical instability, including the ongoing Ukraine and Israel wars and tensions involving China 
<br>and the U.S.; the impact of any future contingencies, including, but not limited to, legal costs and settlements, the imposition of fines or monetary penalties, 
<br>increases in Card Member remediation, investment gains or losses, restructurings, impairments and changes in reserves; issues impacting brand 

<br>perceptions and the company’s reputation; impacts related to new or renegotiated cobrand and other partner agreements and joint ventures; and the impact 

<br>of regulation and litigation, which could affect the profitability of the company’s business activities, limit the company’s ability to pursue business 

<br>opportunities, require changes to business practices or alter the company’s relationships with Card Members, partners and merchants;

</li></ul>
<h4>Forward Looking Statements</h4>
<p>36</p>


<ul>
<li> the company’s ability to achieve its 2024 revenue growth outlook and grow revenues net of interest expense in the future consistent with the company’s <br>growth aspiration, which could be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified above and in the subsequent paragraphs, as well as the following: 

<br>spending volumes and the spending environment not being consistent with expectations, including T&amp;E spend growing slower than expected, further 

<br>slowing in spend by U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise or U.S. large and global corporate customers, or a general slowdown or increase in volatility in 
<br>consumer and business spending volumes; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; an inability to address competitive pressures, innovate and expand 
<br>the company’s products and services, leverage the advantages of the company’s differentiated business model, attract customers across generations and 

<br>age cohorts, including Millennial and Gen Z, and implement strategies and business initiatives, including within the premium consumer space, commercial 
<br>payments and the global merchant network; the effects of the end of the moratorium on student loan repayments; the impact of the decommissioning of one 
<br>of the company’s alternative payment solutions; and merchant discount rates changing by a greater or lesser amount than expected;

</li>
<li> net card fees not performing consistently with expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions <br>impacting the ability and desire of Card Members to pay card fees; higher Card Member attrition rates; the pace of Card Member acquisition activity and 
<br>demand for our fee-based products; and the company’s inability to address competitive pressures, develop attractive premium value propositions and 

<br>implement its strategy of refreshing card products, enhancing benefits and services and continuing to innovate with respect to its products;
</li>
<li> net interest income, the effects of changes in interest rates and the growth of loans and Card Member receivables outstanding, and the portion of which that <br>is interest bearing, being higher or lower than expectations, which could be impacted by, among other things, the behavior and financial strength of Card 
<br>Members and their actual spending, borrowing and paydown patterns; the company’s ability to effectively manage risk and enhance Card Member value 

<br>propositions; changes in benchmark interest rates, including where such changes affect the company’s assets or liabilities differently than expected; 

<br>changes in capital and credit market conditions and the availability and cost of capital; credit actions, including line size and other adjustments to credit 

<br>availability; the yield on Card Member loans not remaining consistent with current expectations; the company’s deposit levels or the interest rates it offers on 

<br>deposits changing from current expectations; and the effectiveness of the company’s strategies to capture a greater share of existing Card Members’ 

<br>spending and borrowings, and attract new, and retain existing, customers;
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Forward Looking Statements</h4>
<p>37</p>


<ul>
<li> future credit performance, the level of future delinquency, reserve and write-off rates and the amount and timing of future reserve builds and releases, which <br>will depend in part on macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, GDP and the volume of bankruptcies; the ability and willingness of Card 
<br>Members to pay amounts owed to the company; changes in consumer behavior that affect loan and receivable balances (such as paydown and revolve 
<br>rates); the credit profiles of new customers acquired; the enrollment in, and effectiveness of, financial relief programs and the performance of accounts as 
<br>they exit from such programs; collections capabilities and recoveries of previously written-off loans and receivables; and governmental actions providing 
<br>forms of relief with respect to certain loans and fees, and the termination of such actions;
</li>
<li> the actual amount to be spent on Card Member rewards and services and business development, and the relationship of these variable customer <br>engagement costs to revenues, which could be impacted by continued changes in macroeconomic conditions and Card Member behavior as it relates to 
<br>their spending patterns (including the level of spend in bonus categories), the redemption of rewards and offers (including travel redemptions) and usage of 
<br>travel-related benefits; the costs related to reward point redemptions; further enhancements to product benefits to make them attractive to Card Members 
<br>and prospective customers, potentially in a manner that is not cost effective; new and renegotiated contractual obligations with business partners; and the 
<br>pace and cost of the expansion of the company’s global lounge collection;
