<p>2023 PROXY STATEMENT 1 </p>
<h6>Proxy Summary</h6>
<h16>Our Company’s Strategic Imperatives</h16><p>American Express Company (the Company) is a globally integrated payments company, providing customers with access to<br>products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our integrated payments platform includes card-<br>issuing, merchant-acquiring and card network businesses. We are a leader in providing credit and charge cards to a broad range of<br>customers, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations around the world. We seek to grow<br>by focusing on four strategic imperatives:</p>
<h42>Expand leadership</h42><h42>in the premium</h42><h42>consumer space</h42><h42>Build on our strong</h42><h42>position in commercial</h42><h42>payments</h42><h42>Strengthen our global,</h42><h42>integrated network</h42><h42>Build on our unique</h42><h42>global position</h42><h16>Business Performance</h16><p>Our 2022 results demonstrate that our growth plan is working, driving Card Member engagement, acquisition and retention.<br>Business performance highlights in 2022 include:</p>
<h31>▪ Grew worldwide network volumes</h31><p>(1)</p>
<p>by 21% versus the prior</p>
<p>year, or 24% on an FX-adjusted basis</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>, with growth driven</p>
<p>across customer types and geographies;</p>
<h31>▪ Added a record 12.5 million new proprietary cards;</h31><h31>▪ Maintained strong customer satisfaction scores and</h31><p>retention rates, above pre-pandemic (2019) levels;</p>
<h31>▪ Saw strong, industry-leading credit performance;</h31><h31>▪ Sustained virtual parity coverage in the U.S., with</h31><p>approximately 99% of credit-card accepting merchants able<br>to accept American Express</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>, and continued to grow</p>
<p>international coverage; and</p>
<h31>▪ Continued to invest in our brand, value propositions,</h31><p>customers, colleagues and technology, while retaining<br>financial flexibility.</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Represents transaction volumes on payment products issued by American Express (billed business) and transaction volumes from cards issued by network<br>partners and alternative payment solutions facilitated by American Express (processed volumes).</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>FX-adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars</p>
<p>(i.e., assumes 2022 foreign exchange rates apply to 2021 results).</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Source: Company internal data and The Nilson Report, February 2023.</p>
<h16>Financial Results</h16><p>2022 financial highlights include:</p>
<h31>▪ Delivered $52.9 billion in revenue, an all-time high;</h31><h31>▪ Total revenue for the year grew by 25% versus the prior year,</h31><p>or 27% on an FX-adjusted basis</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>;</p>
<h31>▪ Revenue growth was broad-based, driven by a mix of spend,</h31><p>lend and fee revenue;</p>
<h31>▪ Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the full year 2022 were</h31><p>$9.85; and</p>
<h31>▪ Return on equity (ROE) was 32.3% and we returned</h31><p>$4.9 billion of capital to our shareholders through both share<br>repurchases and dividends.</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>FX-adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars<br>(i.e., assumes 2022 foreign exchange rates apply to 2021 results). Total revenues net of interest expense on an FX-adjusted basis is a non-GAAP measure. See<br>Annex A for a reconciliation. Management believes the presentation of information on an FX-adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to<br>compare the Company’s performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.</p>

<h16>How Our Compensation Program Supports Our Business Strategy</h16><p>Our executive compensation program is designed to support the longevity and stability of the Company by driving long-term<br>business outcomes, promoting strong governance practices and encouraging responsible risk-taking. This is achieved by linking<br>individual pay with the Company’s performance on a diverse set of measures as well as financial and strategic goals. All senior<br>executives have a large portion of compensation that is variable and covers annual and multi-year performance periods. Long-Term<br>Incentive Awards are designed to align executives with the Company’s long-term performance using performance-based equity<br>awards in the form of Performance Restricted Stock Units and Stock Options. Further, the Company Scorecard incentivizes<br>performance and includes key objectives in four categories: Shareholder, Customer, Colleague and Strategic.<br>In 2022, the Compensation and Benefits Committee modified its charter to reflect its ongoing activity in reviewing strategies relating</p>
<p>to colleague health and wellbeing in addition to Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DE&amp;I), pay equity and talent. It also increased its focus</p>
<p>on reviewing incentive plan performance. Executive compensation continues to be linked to our Environmental, Social and<br>Governance (ESG) goals, including diversity representation, talent retention, culture and inclusion metrics in the Colleague category<br>of the Company’s Scorecard and key ESG initiatives in the Strategic category of our Company Scorecard.<br>To support strong oversight, our Board’s Compensation and Benefits Committee approves performance goals across our categories<br>and certifies performance outcomes.<br>Our executive compensation program, including compensation principles and strategy, is discussed in detail under the<br>Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement.</p>

<h6>Corporate Governance at American Express</h6>
<h16>Item 1: Election of Directors for a Term of One Year</h16><h13>The Board recommends a vote FOR each of the Director</h13><h13>Nominees.</h13><p>Our Board welcomed two new independent directors during 2022. Walter J. Clayton III was elected to our Board on October 5, 2022<br>and joined our Risk Committee on March 8, 2023. Deborah P. Majoras was elected to our Board on December 7, 2022 and joined our<br>Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee on March 8, 2023. Both Mr. Clayton and Ms. Majoras bring to the<br>Board and its committees significant experience as described herein, and we look forward to their continued contributions.<br>Our Board currently has 16 members. Fourteen of our directors are standing for re-election to hold office until the 2024 Annual<br>Meeting of Shareholders or until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Two of our current directors, Charlene Barshefsky<br>and Michael O. Leavitt, are retiring and not standing for re-election. For more information, please see Our Retiring Directors on page<br>15. Our Board has appointed Laureen E. Seeger, Kristina V. Fink and David A. Kanarek as proxies to vote your shares on your behalf.<br>The proxies intend to vote for the election of each of the 14 candidates nominated by the Board unless you indicate otherwise on your<br>proxy or voting instruction form or when you vote by telephone or online. Each candidate has consented to being named in this proxy<br>statement and serving as a director, if elected. However, if any nominee is not able to serve, the Board can either nominate a different<br>person or reduce the size of the Board. If the Board nominates another individual, the persons named as proxies may vote for that<br>nominee.</p>
<h16>Our Board’s Composition</h16><p>As illustrated by our Board experience and diversity matrix and the director biographies on pages 6-14, our Board is made up of a<br>diverse group of leaders with substantial experience in their respective fields. Our Board believes that the combination of the various<br>skills, qualifications and experiences of the director nominees contributes to an effective and well-functioning Board and that,<br>individually and as a whole, the director nominees possess the necessary qualifications to provide effective oversight and insightful<br>strategic guidance.<br>We continually review our Board’s composition to identify the skills needed for our Company both in the near term and into the<br>future. Ongoing strategic board succession planning, along with our mandatory retirement age for directors, are designed to ensure<br>that the Board continues to maintain an appropriate mix of objectivity, skills and experiences to provide fresh perspectives and<br>effective oversight and guidance to management, while leveraging the institutional knowledge and historical perspective of our<br>longer-tenured directors. Over the next few years, certain of our current Board members will retire due to our mandatory retirement<br>age. With this in mind, our Board has been actively engaged in succession planning and added seven new members since 2020. We<br>believe that increasing the size of our Board in the short term to allow for knowledge transfer and information sharing between our<br>newer directors and our retiring directors will help ensure an orderly and effective Board succession process over the next few years.</p>

<p>2023 PROXY STATEMENT 15 </p>
<h16>Our Retiring Directors</h16><p>Charlene Barshefsky and Michael O. Leavitt are retiring from our Board at the end of their current terms and, therefore, will not stand<br>for reelection at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. We thank them for their years of dedicated service and wish them continued<br>success in the future.</p>
<h16>Ideal Director Nominee Attributes</h16><p>The Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee assesses potential candidates based on their history of<br>achievement, the breadth of their business experiences, whether they bring specific skills or expertise in areas that the committee<br>has identified as desired and whether they possess personal attributes and experiences that will contribute to the sound functioning<br>of our Board.<br>Diversity is also a key consideration in our nomination and succession planning processes. Our Corporate Governance Principles<br>provide that the Board should be diverse, engaged and independent. When reviewing potential director nominees, the Nominating,<br>Governance and Public Responsibility Committee considers the holistic diversity of the Board, including gender, race, ethnicity, age,<br>sexual orientation and nationality, and does not discriminate on any basis. Specifically, we seek individuals who:</p>
<h31>▪ have established records of significant accomplishment in</h31><p>leading global businesses and large, complex organizations</p>
<h31>▪ have achieved prominence in their fields and possess skills or</h31><p>significant experience in areas of importance to our business<br>strategy and expected future business needs</p>
<h31>▪ possess integrity, independence, energy, forthrightness,</h31><p>strong analytical skills and the commitment to devote the<br>necessary time and attention to the Company’s affairs</p>
<h31>▪ demonstrate they can constructively challenge and stimulate</h31><p>management and exercise sound judgment</p>
<h31>▪ demonstrate a willingness to work as part of a team in an</h31><p>atmosphere of trust and candor and a commitment to<br>represent the interests of all shareholders rather than those<br>of a specific constituency</p>
<h31>▪ will contribute to the diversity of skills, experience and</h31><p>backgrounds on our Board</p>
<h20>Process for Identifying and Adding New Directors</h20><p>The Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee uses a professional search firm to help identify, evaluate and<br>conduct due diligence on potential director candidates. Using a professional search firm supports the committee in conducting a<br>broad search and looking at a diverse pool of potential candidates. The committee also maintains an ongoing list of potential<br>candidates and considers recommendations made by the Board’s independent directors.<br>In addition, the Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee considers all shareholder recommendations for<br>director candidates and applies the same standards in considering candidates submitted by shareholders as it does in evaluating all<br>other candidates. Shareholders can recommend candidates by writing to the Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility<br>Committee in care of the Company’s Corporate Secretary and Chief Governance Officer, whose contact information is on page 32.<br>Shareholders who wish to submit nominees for election at an annual or special meeting of shareholders should follow the procedure</p>

<h16>Director Onboarding</h16><p>The Company maintains a comprehensive director onboarding program. The Company’s director onboarding program is individually<br>tailored to take into account a director’s prior experience and background and includes one-on-one meetings with several members<br>of senior management. Our onboarding process is regularly updated and focuses on introducing new directors and facilitating<br>integration on the Board.</p>
<h16>Our Board Evaluation Process</h16><p>Our Board continually seeks to improve its performance. Our Lead Independent Director has regular one-on-one discussions with our<br>Board members and conveys their feedback on an ongoing basis to our Chairman.

Conducting a robust annual evaluation process allows the Board to assess<br>its performance and practices and identify areas for improvement. As part of the evaluation process, our Board analyzes and<br>assesses the performance of both the Chairman and the Lead Independent Director, as well as the culture of the Board.<br>Our annual Board evaluations cover several areas, including the following:</p>
<p>Board efficiency and overall effectiveness<br>Board and committee structure<br>Board and committee composition<br>Satisfaction with the performance of the Chairman<br>Satisfaction with the performance of the Lead Independent Director<br>Board member access to the Lead Independent Director, CEO and other members of senior management<br>Quality of Board discussions and balance between presentations and discussion<br>Quality and clarity of materials presented to directors<br>Board and committee information needs<br>Satisfaction with Board agendas and the frequency and format of meetings and time allocations<br>Areas where directors want to increase their focus<br>Board dynamics and culture<br>Board and committee access to experts and advisors<br>Satisfaction with the format of the evaluation</p>

<p>2023 PROXY STATEMENT 19 </p>
<h16>Our Board Leadership Structure</h16><p>Our Board is led by Mr. Brennan, our Lead Independent Director, and Mr. Squeri, our Chairman and CEO. We believe that strong<br>independent leadership is essential for our Board to effectively perform its primary oversight functions and constructively challenge<br>management. We also believe it is critically important for our Board to retain flexibility to determine its leadership structure based on<br>the particular composition of the Board, the individuals serving in leadership positions, the needs and opportunities of the Company<br>as they change over time and considerations such as continuity of leadership, sound succession planning and the additional factors<br>described below.<br>The Board believes that a combined Chairman and CEO role allows the Company to effectively convey its business strategy and core<br>values to shareholders, customers, colleagues, regulators and the public in a single, consistent voice. The Board also recognizes the<br>necessity of having a strong Lead Independent Director with a clearly defined role and set of responsibilities (as detailed below)<br>where there is a combined Chairman and CEO or where the Chairman is not independent. Their leadership is supplemented by<br>engaged and expert committee chairs along with independent-minded, skilled and committed directors.<br>Our Board and Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee recently completed their annual review of the Board’s<br>leadership structure, and the independent directors re-elected Mr. Brennan as Lead Independent Director, a position he has held<br>since September 2021. The annual Board leadership review considered how Mr. Brennan’s past experience would prepare him to<br>perform the duties set forth below as Lead Independent Director as well as the insightful, effective and sound leadership provided by<br>Mr. Brennan. The annual board leadership review also considers the tangible benefits to the Company of having a Chairman and CEO<br>with an operational focus and extensive company experience given the global and complex nature of our business. In addition, the<br>review also considered how the Company’s robust corporate governance practices combined with the Board’s current leadership<br>structure helps to ensure both clear, strategic alignment throughout the Company and independent oversight of management.<br>Taking all of this into account, our Board continues to believe that our current structure, led by Messrs. Brennan and Squeri, allows<br>the Board to focus on key strategic, policy and operational issues, provides critical and effective leadership (both internally and<br>externally), and creates an environment in which the Board can work effectively and appropriately challenge management, all of<br>which we believe will benefit the long-term interests of our shareholders.</p>
<h20>Strong Lead Independent Director with Defined Role and Responsibilities</h20><p>As noted above, the Board recognizes that in circumstances like ours where the positions of Chairman and CEO are combined, a<br>strong Lead Independent Director with a clearly defined role and set of responsibilities is paramount for constructive and effective<br>leadership.<br>Mr. Brennan, the Board’s Lead Independent Director, has been a member of the Board since 2017. During his tenure as a Board<br>member, Mr. Brennan has established strong and effective working relationships with his fellow directors and garnered their trust<br>and respect. Furthermore, he has demonstrated strong leadership skills, independent thinking and a deep understanding of our<br>business. Mr. Brennan chairs the Compensation and Benefits Committee and is a member of the Audit and Compliance Committee.<br>He was the Chair of the Risk Committee up until his election as Lead Independent Director in September 2021 and regularly attends<br>Risk Committee and Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee meetings as an observer.<br>The position of Lead Independent Director at American Express comes with a clear mandate and significant authority and<br>responsibilities that are detailed below and can be found in our Board-approved Corporate Governance Principles. Mr. Brennan fulfills<br>these responsibilities in his role as Lead Independent Director.</p>
<p>Preside at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including the executive sessions of the independent<br>directors, and apprise the Chairman of the issues considered and decisions reached at those sessions;<br>Call additional meetings of the independent directors as needed;<br>Lead the Board in putting forth its expectations for “tone at the top;”<br>Meet regularly with the Chairman and serve as a liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors;<br>Facilitate effective and candid communication to optimize Board performance;<br>Serve as the Chair of the Compensation and Benefits Committee;<br>Coordinate with the Chair of the Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee (as needed) to recruit and<br>interview qualified candidates for the Board;<br>Lead the annual evaluation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and together with the Chair of the Nominating,<br>Governance and Public Responsibility Committee, the evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board;</p>

At the beginning of each year, our senior<br>management presents our consolidated annual business plan to the Board, and the Board discusses the Company’s results relative<br>to the plan periodically throughout the year. The Board holds senior management accountable for effectively implementing the<br>Company’s strategy consistent with its risk appetite, while maintaining an effective risk management framework and system of<br>internal controls. Each year the Board holds an offsite strategy meeting to conduct a deep dive into the Company’s strategic goals,<br>timeline to achieve these goals and execution plans.</p>

<h16>How our Board Engages in Ongoing CEO and Key Executive</h16><h16>Succession Planning</h16><p>Our Board ensures that we have the right management talent to pursue our strategies successfully.<br>The entire Board is involved in the critical aspects of the CEO succession planning process, including establishing selection criteria<br>that reflect our business strategies, identifying and evaluating potential internal candidates and making key management succession<br>decisions. Succession and development plans are regularly discussed with the CEO as well as without the CEO present in executive<br>sessions of the Board. The Board makes sure that it has adequate opportunities to meet with and assess development plans for<br>potential CEO and senior management successors to address identified gaps in skills and attributes. This occurs through various<br>means, including informal meetings, Board dinners, presentations to the Board and committees, attendance at Board meetings and<br>the comprehensive annual talent review. In addition, the Board has developed and approved an emergency CEO succession plan.<br>The Board also oversees management’s succession planning for other key executive positions. Our Board calendar includes at least<br>one meeting each year at which the Board conducts a detailed talent review, which includes a review of the Company’s talent<br>strategies, leadership pipeline and succession plans for key executive positions.<br>Additionally, the detailed results of the Company’s Annual Colleague Experience Survey are reviewed each year with the Board. Our<br>Annual Colleague Experience Survey provides insights into employee satisfaction, leadership efficacy, learning opportunities and<br>career development. The insights provided by the survey help improve the American Express colleague experience, workplace<br>culture and business results. We believe that maintaining our strong workplace culture, adhering to our Blue Box Values and ensuring<br>that our people feel included, valued, recognized and backed will help us attract, retain and develop the right talent to lead the<br>Company and successfully execute our corporate strategy.

<h29> 22 2023 PROXY STATEMENT</h29><h16>How our Board Oversees Risk Management</h16><h20>Board of Directors</h20><p>We are committed to Board-level oversight of risk management. Our Board monitors our “tone at the top” and risk culture and<br>oversees emerging and strategic risks. Our CEO, other executive officers and other members of our management team regularly<br>report to the Board and its committees to discuss short-term, intermediate-term and long-term risks, including credit risk, market</p>
<p>risk, funding and liquidity risk, compliance risk, operational risk (including, but not limited to, conduct risk), reputational risk, country<br>risk, model risk, strategic and business risk and ESG risk (including, but not limited to, climate change risk). These reports assist in</p>
<p>the Board’s oversight of risk management and the ongoing evaluation of management controls. Risk management is primarily<br>overseen by our Board through three Board committees: Risk, Audit and Compliance and Compensation and Benefits. Each<br>committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the Board regarding matters reviewed at their<br>committee. The committees meet regularly in executive sessions with our CFO, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Global<br>Compliance Officer (who reports to our Chief Risk Officer), Chief Audit Executive and other members of senior management with<br>regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent and capabilities. The Board believes that these meetings help promote an<br>effective ongoing risk dialogue between the Board and management.</p>
<p>Mr. Brennan, the Lead Independent Director, chairs the Compensation and Benefits Committee and is a member of the Audit and</p>
<p>Compliance Committee. He was the Chair of the Risk Committee up until his election as Lead Independent Director in September 2021<br>and regularly attends Risk Committee and Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee meetings as an observer. As<br>a Bank Holding Company with greater than $100 billion in total assets, the Company is required under the Federal Reserve’s<br>“Enhanced Prudential Standards” to have a stand-alone Risk Committee, which must include at least one member with “experience in</p>
<p>identifying, assessing and managing risk exposures of large, complex financial firms.” Mr. Brennan met this requirement when he was a</p>
<p>member of the Risk Committee based on his experience with a variety of diverse financial companies, including, without limitation, his</p>
<p>current and prior experience on the Company’s Board, including serving as the former chair of the Risk Committee and his prior<br>professional experience as former Chairman, CEO and CFO of Vanguard. Vanguard is one of the largest investment companies in the</p>
<p>world focused on consumer-oriented products and services, and Mr. Brennan’s leadership roles at Vanguard further demonstrate his</p>
<p>experience in identifying, assessing and managing the risk exposures of a large, complex financial firm in a highly regulated sector.</p>
<p>Specifically, Mr. Brennan was the Chairman and CEO of Vanguard for over a decade and spent another five years, prior to being</p>
<p>appointed CEO, as the CFO of Vanguard. As CEO of Vanguard, Mr. Brennan was involved in, and was ultimately responsible for, risk<br>management with respect to many of the same categories of risks faced by the Company, including credit risk, interest rate risk,<br>liquidity risk, technology risk, operational risk, reputational risk and compliance and legal risk. Moreover, during his time at Vanguard</p>
<p>and as part of its substantial expansion under his leadership, many of Vanguard’s risk management processes were necessarily<br>enhanced over time. In addition, the Board believes that Mr. Brennan’s current and prior board service for external companies also</p>
<p>support his risk management qualifications, including through his prior roles as Lead Governor and then Chairman of the FINRA.</p>

<h29> 24 2023 PROXY STATEMENT</h29><h20>Board Oversight of Cybersecurity</h20><p>We are a global financial services company and understand the substantial operational risks for companies in our industry as well as<br>the importance of preserving the trust of our customers and protecting personal information. To that end, we have an extensive<br>cybersecurity governance framework in place. Our Board receives reports on cybersecurity at least once a year and our Risk<br>Committee receives reports on cybersecurity at least twice a year, including in at least one joint meeting with the Audit and<br>Compliance Committee, and all receive ad hoc updates as needed. In addition, the Risk Committee annually approves the Company’s<br>Information Security Program.<br>Our information and cybersecurity program is designed to protect information and information systems from unauthorized access,<br>use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction. The program is built upon a foundation of advanced security technology, a<br>well-staffed and highly trained team of experts and operations based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology<br>Cybersecurity Framework. This consists of controls designed to identify, protect, detect, respond to and recover from information<br>and cybersecurity incidents. The framework defines risks and associated controls which are embedded in our processes and<br>technology. Those controls are measured and monitored by a combination of subject matter experts and a security operations center<br>with our integrated cyber detection, response and recovery capabilities.</p>
<p>Program Highlights</p>
<p>We have a Cyber Crisis Response Plan in place that provides a documented framework for handling high-severity security<br>incidents and facilitates coordination across multiple parts of the Company<br>We deploy multiple layers of controls, including embedding security into our technology investments<br>We invest in threat intelligence and are active participants in industry and government forums to improve sector<br>cybersecurity defense<br>We collaborate with our peers in the areas of threat intelligence, vulnerability management and response and drills<br>We routinely perform simulations and drills at both a technical and management level<br>We incorporate external expertise and reviews in our program<br>All colleagues receive annual cybersecurity awareness training</p>
<p>We continuously assess the risks and changes in the cyber environment and dynamically adjust our program and investments as<br>appropriate.</p>
<h20>How our Management Oversees Risk</h20><p>We use our comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, measure, report and<br>manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of<br>the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer.<br>There are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our<br>Chief Risk Officer. The ERMC is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk<br>governance, risk oversight and risk appetite. It maintains the enterprise-wide Risk Appetite Framework and monitors compliance with<br>limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of certain risk policies Company-wide. The ERMC reviews key<br>risk exposures, trends and concentrations, and significant compliance matters, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor,<br>control and report major risks. In addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our CFO, is responsible for managing our capital,<br>funding and liquidity, investment, market risk and asset/liability activities in accordance with our policies and in compliance with<br>applicable regulatory requirements. The Credit Reserves Committee, co-chaired by our CFO and Chief Credit Officer, oversees the<br>measurement and financial recognition of the Company’s balance sheet related reserves for credit losses.<br>As defined in the ERM policy, we follow the “three lines of defense” approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises<br>functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. Our CEO, business unit presidents and our CFO are part of the<br>first line of defense. The second line of defense comprises independent functions overseeing risk-taking activities of the first line. The<br>Chief Risk Officer, the Global Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief Operational Risk Officer and certain control groups, both at the<br>enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The global risk oversight team oversees the<br>policies, strategies, frameworks, models, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and<br>independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks. Our Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of<br>defense and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense.</p>

<h16>Our Corporate Governance Framework</h16><p>We have adopted Corporate Governance Principles that, together with the charters of the four standing committees of the Board<br>(Audit and Compliance, Compensation and Benefits, Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility and Risk), our Code of<br>Conduct (which constitutes our code of ethics for colleagues) and the Code of Business Conduct for Members of the Board of<br>Directors, provide our governance framework. Key governance policies and processes also include our Whistleblower Policy, our<br>comprehensive ERM Program, our commitment to transparent financial reporting and our systems of internal checks and balances.<br>Comprehensive management policies, many of which are approved at the Board committee level, guide the Company’s operations.<br>Our Board, along with management, regularly reviews our Corporate Governance Principles and practices to ensure that they are<br>appropriate and reflect our high standards and Blue Box Values. In reviewing our Corporate Governance Principles and making<br>recommendations, the Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee considers the views of shareholders expressed<br>to us in engagement meetings, as well as publicly available discourse on governance.<br>You may view the following documents by clicking on the “Corporate Governance” link found on our Investor Relations webpage at<br>http://ir.americanexpress.com and then selecting “Governance Framework.” You may also access our Investor Relations webpage<br>through our main website at www.americanexpress.com by clicking on the “About American Express” link, which is located at the<br>bottom of the Company’s homepage.

<h31>▪ Corporate Governance Principles</h31><h31>▪ Charters for each of the four standing Board committees</h31><h31>▪ Code of Conduct (which constitutes our code of ethics for colleagues)</h31><h31>▪ Code of Business Conduct for Members of the Board of Directors</h31><h20>Majority Voting Standard for Director Elections</h20><p>In a non-contested election, directors are elected by a majority of “for” votes cast by shareholders. A non-contested election is an<br>election where the number of nominees is the same as the number of directors to be elected. If a director receives a greater number<br>of votes “against” than votes “for” his or her election, the director is required to immediately submit his or her resignation to the<br>Board. The Board, excluding such individual, will decide whether or not to accept such resignation and will promptly disclose and<br>explain its decision in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC.<br>In a contested election, the director nominees who receive the plurality of votes cast are elected as directors. Under the plurality<br>standard, the number of persons equal to the number of vacancies to be filled who receive more votes than other nominees are<br>elected to the Board, regardless of whether they receive a majority of votes cast. An election is considered contested under our<br>Certificate of Incorporation if there are more nominees than positions on the Board to be filled at the meeting of shareholders as of<br>the fourteenth day prior to the date on which we file our definitive proxy statement with the SEC.</p>
<h20>Our Policy on Director Outside Board Commitments</h20><p>Our Board expects individual directors to allot sufficient time and attention to Company matters and to use their judgment and<br>consider all of their commitments when accepting additional directorships on other corporations or charitable organizations. Our<br>Board also recognizes that some directors have the time and ability to maintain the focus and commitment expected at our Board<br>and committee meetings as well as those of other public companies. Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that a director<br>should not serve on the boards of more than four public companies (including ours) or, if the director is an active Chief Executive<br>Officer or equivalent of another public company, on the boards of more than three public companies (including ours). Additionally, a<br>director who serves on our Audit and Compliance Committee should not serve on more than two other public company audit<br>committees. Our Board believes that our policy strikes the right balance by allowing for the depth and breadth of experience gained<br>through membership on other boards and the time commitment needed for engaged board service.<br>Our Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee believes it is important for directors to balance the insights gained<br>from their roles on other boards with the ability to prepare for, attend and participate effectively in our Board and committee<br>meetings. As a result, the Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee evaluates director performance to ensure<br>directors continue to have the time and commitment to fulfill their obligations to our Board. When vetting prospective directors, a key<br>component of the Company’s due diligence process includes inquiry into whether an individual has sufficient capacity to devote to</p>

<h29> 28 2023 PROXY STATEMENT</h29><p>being an engaged and productive member of our Board. During the annual re-nomination process, the Nominating, Governance and<br>Public Responsibility Committee considers a number of factors when deciding whether to renominate a director, including meeting<br>attendance, individual contributions at meetings, the role of a director on other boards (with consideration given to public company<br>board leadership positions), the commitment levels and time demands of outside activities, peer review feedback from one-on-one<br>meetings held by each of our Chairman and Lead Independent Director with directors throughout the year and the results of the<br>annual Board evaluation. Specifically, our annual evaluation process overseen by the Nominating, Governance and Public<br>Responsibility Committee addresses topics including director commitment levels, engagement, effectiveness and preparedness, and<br>the results are discussed by each committee and our Board. Our Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee<br>confirms that all of our directors standing for re-election comply with our outside board commitment policy at this time.<br>We are aware that some of our shareholders have their own outside board commitment policies that are more restrictive than our<br>policy and, specifically, that Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr. exceeds some of our shareholders’ policies as a public company CEO sitting on<br>three public company boards. As indicated above, when our Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee was<br>considering whether to nominate Mr. Baltimore to our Board, extensive due diligence regarding his capacity to serve was conducted,<br>including consideration of his other public company leadership roles and outside commitments. Mr. Baltimore has a long-standing<br>track record of effective engagement and consistent attendance records, and has continuously shown himself to be a prepared and<br>active participant on our Board. Our Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee reviewed and considered the<br>factors and information described above when deciding to re-nominate Mr. Baltimore again this year. Mr. Baltimore has also met with<br>certain of our shareholders at their request to discuss his board commitments and his capacity to serve. Our Board believed at the<br>time of his initial nomination, and continues to believe, that Mr. Baltimore allocates ample time and attention to Company matters, is<br>a valued asset to our Board and has demonstrated his ability to fulfill his Board responsibilities to the satisfaction of our Board.<br>Our Board seeks the right mix of directors with skills to accomplish our long-term goals and strategy, and conducts extensive due<br>diligence when evaluating prospective director nominees and during the annual renomination process. Our Board requests that<br>shareholders consider the points above when applying their respective director commitment criteria and/or policies.</p>
<h20>Director Attendance</h20><p>Our Meeting Attendance Policy is set forth in our Corporate Governance Principles. During 2022, our Board met six times and our<br>committees met 28 times. All directors attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Board and Board committees on which they<br>served in 2022.<br>All of our directors serving on our Board at the time of our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders attended the meeting. Our Board<br>strongly encourages all of its members to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders but understands there may be circumstances<br>that prevent such attendance.</p>
<h20>Executive Sessions</h20><p>Executive sessions of independent directors, led by our Lead Independent Director, enable the Board to discuss matters, such as<br>strategy, emerging risks and external threats, CEO and senior management performance and compensation, succession planning<br>and board effectiveness, without management present. Any director may request additional executive sessions of independent<br>directors. During 2022, our independent directors met in executive session at each regularly scheduled Board meeting.</p>
<h20>Our Board’s Size</h20><p>Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that while the Board need not adhere to a fixed number of directors, generally a Board<br>of 12-14 directors offers a sufficiently large and diverse group to address the important issues facing the Company and provides a<br>wide range of perspectives, while being small enough to encourage personal involvement and discussion. We recognize that at times<br>the number of directors on our Board may be higher than this range during periods of succession planning-related transitions, and<br>when this occurs, expect the size of our Board to subsequently come back to within this range (12-14) as directors do not stand for<br>re-election in accordance with our mandatory retirement age or to pursue other interests.</p>
<h20>Proxy Access</h20><p>A shareholder or group of no more than 20 shareholders that has owned at least 3% of our common shares for at least three years<br>may nominate directors to our Board and include the nominees in our proxy materials to be voted on at our Annual Meeting of<br>Shareholders. The maximum number of shareholder nominees that will be included in our proxy materials with respect to any such<br>Annual Meeting of Shareholders is the greater of (i) two, or (ii) 20% of directors to be elected. A shareholder who seeks to nominate a<br>director or directors to our Board must provide proper notice to the Company’s Corporate Secretary and Chief Governance Officer<br>under the terms of our bylaws.</p>

<p>to non-profit organizations.<br>Based on our guidelines, the Board determined in March 2023 that all of its members in 2022, other than Mr. Squeri, and all of the</p>
<p>Board’s director nominees for election at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, other than Mr. Squeri, are independent.<br>On October 5, 2022, our Board elected Mr. Clayton as an independent director. Mr. Clayton is a Senior Policy Advisor and Of Counsel<br>at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP. From time to time and in the ordinary course of business, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP provides legal services<br>to the Company that we consider to be de minimis in nature. Mr. Clayton does not provide any legal services to the Company, and he<br>does not receive any compensation from Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP that is generated by or related to our payments to that firm. The<br>Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee determined based on fees paid to the firm over the past three years<br>that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP does not perform substantial legal services for the Company on a regular basis. The fees and expenses<br>paid to Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP represented less than 0.5 percent of the firm’s consolidated gross revenues in each of the past three<br>years, and represented less than 0.1 percent of the Company’s revenue in each such year. Further, the Nominating, Governance and<br>Public Responsibility Committee reviewed the nature of the Company’s engagement of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP and the services<br>rendered, including the expertise and relevant experience of the firm and the specific partners engaged to work on the matters for<br>which we have engaged the firm, and determined that Mr. Clayton’s service on the Company’s Board should not impair the<br>Company’s ability to engage Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP when the Company determines such engagements to be appropriate and in our</p>
<p>best interests. The Committee is satisfied that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP, when engaged for legal work, is chosen by the Company’s</p>
<p>legal group on the basis of the directly relevant factors of experience, expertise and efficiency. After considering the fees and<br>expenses paid and being briefed on the policies and procedures that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP has instituted to confirm that<br>Mr. Clayton has no professional involvement or financial interest in the Company’s dealings with the firm, the Nominating,<br>Governance and Public Responsibility Committee determined and recommended to the Board that the Company’s professional<br>engagement of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP does not impair Mr. Clayton’s independence.</p>

<h16>Compensation of Directors</h16><p>The Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee reviews director compensation and seeks to compensate our<br>directors in a manner that attracts and retains highly qualified directors and aligns the interests of our directors with those of our<br>long-term shareholders. In 2021, the Committee engaged an independent compensation advisory firm, Semler Brossy Consulting<br>Group, to assist the committee in its review of the competitiveness and structure of the Company’s non-management director<br>compensation. This review included a competitive benchmarking of our director compensation against the 20 companies that our<br>Compensation and Benefits Committee reviews as a reference when examining the competitiveness of our executive compensation<br>practices, as well as the Dow 30 and certain financial institutions. After completing its review, the Nominating, Governance and Public</p>
<p>Responsibility Committee recommended modest increases to our program, effective January 1, 2022, in order to better position our</p>
<p>program from a competitive standpoint going forward, as described below.<br>The following table provides information on the 2022 compensation of non-management directors who served for all or a part of<br>2022. We reimburse directors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses attendant to their board service.</p>

<p>(1)</p>
<p>Annual Retainers. For service in 2022, we paid non-management directors an annual retainer of $110,000 for board service. We paid an additional annual</p>
<p>retainer of $20,000 to members of the Audit and Compliance and Risk Committees, $15,000 to members of the Compensation and Benefits Committee and<br>Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee. We also paid an annual retainer to the Chair of each of the Board committees as follows: Audit<br>and Compliance and Risk, $20,000; and Compensation and Benefits and Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility, $15,000. We pay no fees for<br>attending meetings, but the annual retainer for board service of $110,000 is reduced by $20,000 if a director does not attend at least 75% of his or her<br>aggregate board and committee meetings. In addition, our Lead Independent Director during 2022, John Brennan, received an annual retainer of $100,000 of<br>which $25,000 is paid in cash and included in this column and the remaining $75,000 is credited to the director’s stock equivalent unit (SEU) account (see<br>footnote 2).<br>All non-management directors, except Charlene Barshefsky, Theodore J. Leonsis, Karen L. Parkhill, Lynn A. Pike and Ronald A. Williams, deferred all or a<br>portion of their 2022 retainers into a cash account, a SEU account, or both, under the deferred compensation plan described below in footnote 2.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Share Equivalent Unit Plan. To align our non-management directors’ annual compensation with shareholder interests, each non-management director is</p>
<p>credited with common SEUs upon election or reelection at each annual meeting of shareholders. Each SEU reflects the value of one common share. Directors<br>receive additional SEUs as dividend equivalents on the units in their accounts. SEUs do not carry voting rights and must be held at least until a director ends<br>his or her service on the Board. Each SEU is payable in cash equal to the then-value of one common share at the time of distribution to the director. On May 3,<br>2022, the date of last year’s annual meeting, each non-management director elected to the Board was credited with SEUs having a value of $220,000, which<br>consisted of 1,218 SEUs, based on the market price of our common shares for the average of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such date. In addition,<br>our Lead Independent Director during 2022, John J. Brennan, received an annual SEU retainer of $75,000, which consisted of 490 SEUs based on the market<br>price of our common shares for the average of the last 10 trading days of such calendar quarter. We report in this column the aggregate grant date fair value of<br>these SEUs in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation.</p>

<p>cash account in which amounts deferred will be credited at the rate of 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate for December of the prior year, or (2) their<br>SEU account. Directors will receive cash payments upon payout of their deferrals.<br>The balances in directors’ SEU accounts as of December 31, 2022, are set forth in the table below. These amounts represent the aggregate number of SEUs<br>granted under the SEU Plan for all years of service as a director and additional units credited because of the reinvestment of dividend equivalents and, for<br>directors who participated in the SEU option under our deferred compensation plan for directors, retainer amounts deferred into their SEU account and<br>dividend equivalents thereon.</p>

<p>Insurance. We provide our non-management directors with group term life insurance coverage of $50,000. The group life insurance policy is provided to the</p>
<p>directors on a basis generally available to all Company employees. This column includes the premium paid for such coverage.</p>
<p>Dividend Equivalents. Dividend equivalents are reinvested in additional units for all directors based upon total SEUs held as of the previous record date at the</p>
<p>time of Company quarterly dividends. This column includes the fair market value of the dividend equivalents received by the directors during 2022 in these<br>amounts: Mr. Baltimore $5,946, Amb.

<p>Directors’ Charitable Award Program. We maintain a Directors’ Charitable Award Program for directors elected prior to July 1, 2004. To fund this program,</p>
<p>we purchased joint life insurance on the lives of participating directors. The death benefit of $500,000 funds a donation to a charitable organization that the<br>director recommends. The Company paid no premiums for the policies of non-management directors who served for all or part of 2022.</p>
<p>Matching Gift Program. Directors are eligible to participate in the Company’s Matching Gift Program on the same basis as Company employees. Under this</p>
<p>program, the American Express Foundation matches gifts to approved charitable organizations up to $8,000 per calendar year. This column includes the<br>amounts matched with respect to calendar year 2022.</p>
<p>Special Events. In connection with their attendance and participation at The American Express 2022 Golf Tournament, Mr. Baltimore and Mr. Leavitt received</p>
<p>a benefit equivalent to $34,745 and $38,195, respectively, which includes the Pro-Am Player entry fee and other costs associated with participation in the<br>tournament.</p>

<p>2023 PROXY STATEMENT 35 </p>
<h16>Director Stock Ownership</h16><p>Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that non-management directors are required to obtain a personal holding of shares<br>(directly or through SEUs) with a value of $1 million within five years of joining the Board. All non-management directors have<br>achieved or are on track to achieve this requirement during the required time period.</p>
<h16>Director and Officer Liability Insurance</h16><p>We have an insurance program in place to provide coverage for director and officer liability. The coverage provides that, subject to<br>the policy terms and conditions, the insurers will: (i) reimburse us when we are legally permitted to indemnify our directors and<br>officers; (ii) pay losses, including settlements, judgments and legal fees, on behalf of our directors and officers when we cannot<br>indemnify them; and (iii) pay our losses resulting from certain securities claims. A portion of the insurance program is blended with<br>certain other insurances covering the Company. The insurance program is effective from November 30, 2022 to November 30, 2023<br>and is provided by a consortium of insurers. ACE American Insurance Company and XL Specialty Insurance Company are the lead<br>insurers with various other insurers providing excess coverage. We expect to obtain similar coverage upon expiration of the current<br>insurance program. The annual premium for the insurance program is approximately $5.6 million.</p>
<h16>Certain Relationships and Transactions</h16><p>In the ordinary course of our business, we engage in transactions, arrangements and relationships with many other entities, including<br>financial institutions and professional organizations. Some of our directors, director nominees, executive officers, greater than 5%<br>shareholders and their immediate family members (each, a Related Person) may be directors, officers, partners, employees or<br>shareholders of these entities. We carry out transactions with these entities on customary terms and, in many instances, these</p>
<p>Related Persons may not have knowledge of them. To the Company’s knowledge, since January 1, 2022, no Related Person has had a</p>
<p>material interest in any of our ongoing business transactions or relationships except as described in this section.</p>
<h20>Our Related Person Transaction Policy</h20><p>Our written Related Person Transaction Policy governs company transactions, arrangements and relationships involving more than<br>$120,000 in which a Related Person has a direct or indirect material interest (Related Person Transactions). Under the policy, the<br>Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee must provide prior review and oversight of, and approval or<br>disapproval of, Related Person Transactions, other than certain pre-approved transactions (described below). The committee will<br>only approve a transaction if, after reviewing the relevant facts and circumstances, it determines that the transaction is consistent<br>with the best interests of the Company. In the event we become aware of a Related Person Transaction that was not approved under<br>the policy, the committee will consider the options available, including ratification, revision or termination of the transaction. The<br>policy does not supersede any other company policy or procedure that may apply to any Related Person Transaction, including our<br>Corporate Governance Principles and codes of conduct.<br>The Company’s Corporate Secretary is responsible for assisting the Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee in<br>carrying out its responsibilities, and management is required to present to the committee the material facts of any transaction that it<br>believes may require review. In cases when it is impracticable or undesirable to delay a decision on a proposed transaction until the<br>next meeting of the Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee, the Chair may review and approve the transaction<br>and then report any approval to the full committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. If a matter before the Nominating,<br>Governance and Public Responsibility Committee involves a member of the committee, the member must recuse themselves and<br>may not participate in deliberations or vote on the matter.</p>
<h20>Pre-Approved Categories of Related Person Transactions</h20><p>The Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee has pre-approved certain categories of transactions as being<br>consistent with the best interests of the Company. These categories, which may exceed the proscribed threshold for Related Person<br>Transactions, include but are not limited to, director and executive officer compensation, use of Company products and services,<br>transactions involving indebtedness to the Company, certain banking-related transactions, certain ordinary course transactions,<br>charitable contributions and indemnification payments.</p>

For example, our U.S. card-issuing bank may extend credit to our directors and<br>executive officers under our charge or lending products. All indebtedness from these transactions is in the ordinary course of our<br>business and is on the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, in effect for comparable transactions with other people.<br>Such indebtedness involves normal risks of collection and does not have features or terms that are unfavorable to our subsidiaries.<br>Our executive officers and directors may also enter into transactions with us involving other goods and services, such as travel<br>services and investments in deposit products offered by subsidiaries of the Company. These transactions are also in the ordinary<br>course of our business, and we provide them on terms that we offer to our customers generally. Occasionally, we may have<br>employees who are related to our executive officers, directors or director nominees. We compensate these individuals in a manner<br>consistent with our practices that apply to all employees. The sister-in-law of Mr. Squeri, our Chairman and CEO, is employed by the<br>Company in a non-executive position and received compensation in 2022 of between $315,000 and $340,000. The compensation<br>and other terms of employment of Mr. Squeri’s sister-in-law are determined on a basis consistent with the Company’s human<br>resources policies.<br>Certain executive officers, directors and members of their immediate families are directors, employees or have equity interests in<br>companies with whom the Company has entered into ordinary course business relationships from time to time and with whom the<br>Company may enter into additional ordinary course business relationships. These may include ordinary course merchant acceptance<br>relationships pursuant to which these companies accept our charge and credit card products and pay us fees when their customers<br>use these cards, as well as use of the Company’s cards and financial and other products and services, including extensions of credit,<br>on terms and conditions similar to those available to other customers generally. From time to time, we may enter into joint marketing<br>or other relationships with one or more of these companies in the ordinary course that encourage customers to apply for and use our<br>cards. We may engage in other commercial transactions with these companies and pay or receive fees in those transactions. We have<br>a number of similar ordinary course relationships with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and its subsidiaries. We have also purchased<br>insurance and other products from subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in the ordinary course of business and on arm’s-length<br>terms. For information regarding a letter agreement between us and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. related to Berkshire’s investment in the<br>Company, please see Stock Ownership Information on pages 97-98. Additionally, the Company may from time to time make<br>charitable contributions to non-profit organizations where our directors or executive officers are directors or trustees.</p>

Operations include all our managed facilities, field sites and data centers. Managed facilities are<br>individual properties operationally managed by our global real estate team and housing critical business functions. Field sites are individual properties that are<br>not operationally managed by our global real estate team but directly by our business units. They are typically smaller sites, less than 30,000 square feet<br>(including airport lounges, foreign exchange kiosks and sales offices) that are owned or leased by American Express.</p>

<p>The American Express 2022 Small Business Saturday Consumer Insights Survey was conducted by Teneo on behalf of American Express and the National<br>Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). The study is a nationally representative sample of 2,471 U.S. adults 18 years of age or older. The sample was<br>collected using an email invitation and an online survey. The study gathered self-reported data and does not reflect actual receipts or sales. It was conducted<br>anonymously on November 27, 2022. The survey has an overall margin of error of +/- 2.0%, at the 95% level of confidence. Projections are based on the<br>current U.S. Census estimates of the U.S. adult population, age 18 years and over.</p>

<h16>ESG Governance</h16><p>Our Board’s Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee reviews our ESG strategy and Corporate Sustainability<br>program, monitors progress against our goals and provides guidance on our efforts. The Compensation and Benefits Committee of<br>the Board also oversees performance goals and certifies performance outcomes on key talent metrics. The Risk Committee of the<br>Board provides oversight of our ERM framework.<br>Our Executive Committee also reviews and evaluates ESG performance and long-term goals with support from our ESG Steering<br>Committee. Led by senior executives from across the Company, the ESG Steering Committee developed the goals for our ESG<br>strategy, drawing on the expertise of cross-functional ESG Working Groups. Day to day, our Corporate Sustainability team works with<br>colleagues throughout the Company to shape our ESG programs and investments and monitors progress on key issues.<br>Additionally, ESG risks—in particular climate risk—are included in our ERM framework and climate-related risks are currently<br>managed as part of our ERM process. The ERMC, chaired by our Chief Risk Officer, is the highest-level management committee to<br>oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite. Furthermore, we have established<br>a dedicated Climate Risk Management Working Group with direct accountability to the ERMC.<br>Executive compensation is also increasingly linked to our ESG goals. For example, in years past, the Company’s annual scorecard’s<br>Colleague category included diversity representation, talent retention, culture and inclusion metrics as part of the calculation to<br>determine incentive compensation for all eligible colleagues. In 2021, we also incorporated the management of key ESG priorities,<br>including metrics, into our executive compensation program under the Strategic category of our annual scorecard.

Our<br>DE&amp;I framework is comprised of six enterprise-wide pillars. Each pillar is led by members of the Executive Committee as well as<br>designated Senior Executive Sponsors to drive action and accountability. Within each of these pillars, every business unit has a<br>comprehensive, multi-year plan with clear objectives, timelines and metrics (see graphic below).</p>

We review these practices regularly, and since 2017 we have also worked each year<br>with independent experts to conduct a pay equity review.

<p>In 2022, for a third consecutive year, we maintained 100% pay “equity”—meaning no statistical differences in pay—for all genders</p>
<p>globally, as well as for colleagues of all races and ethnicities in the U.S. We continued to make necessary investments and<br>appropriate salary adjustments to reach this goal. We are proud of this achievement and are committed to maintaining this goal<br>going forward.<br>Beginning in 2021, we also raised the level of transparency on pay and other DE&amp;I metrics including disclosing our “raw median pay<br>gap” as well as providing data on the company’s hiring, promotions and retention efforts for colleagues across gender globally and<br>race and ethnicity in the United States. The “raw median pay gap” metric compares differences in raw median base pay making no<br>adjustments for factors such as role, level, tenure, performance or geography.

<h29> 42 2023 PROXY STATEMENT</h29><h16>Creating an Inclusive Workplace Culture</h16><p>Our culture is built on strong relationships, shared values and purpose and our commitment to backing our customers, communities<br>and each other. Our Blue Box Values, a set of guiding principles that include “We Embrace Diversity” and “We Stand for Equity and<br>Inclusion,” serve as the foundation for how we operate and motivate us to actively cultivate an inclusive and diverse workplace.<br>Our Colleague Networks play an important part in the culture of American Express, building community, offering support and<br>fostering a sense of inclusion and belonging. They also serve as an important source for feedback—helping us learn more about the<br>colleague experience and, in turn, guiding the resources, events and backing we provide. We have 14 dedicated Colleague Networks<br>with more than 100 chapters worldwide. They bring together people who share common experiences, interests and backgrounds—<br>including disability, ethnicity, faith, gender, gender identity, generations, sexual orientation and veteran status.<br>Colleagues are welcome to join any network whether they are a member of the community or want to learn more and show their<br>support. Currently, two in five colleagues engage in at least one network. In addition to our Colleague Networks, we have DE&amp;I<br>Councils in place to address Business Unit and local priorities.<br>Having a better understanding of the makeup of Team Amex helps us continue to strengthen our culture of inclusion and belonging.<br>To that end, in 2020, we began to invite colleagues in our largest locations to voluntarily and confidentially self-identify, or Self-ID,<br>across categories like gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity and disability status, depending on their location. We’ve since<br>expanded our Self-ID initiative and it’s now available to 90 percent of colleagues in the following office locations: Argentina, Australia,<br>Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the UK and the U.S.</p>
<h16>Amex Flex: Our New Flexible Way of Working is Working</h16><p>In March 2022, we launched Amex Flex, our new way of working where, depending on role and business needs, colleagues can work in<br>the office, at home, or take a hybrid approach that combines both. Amex Flex is designed to leverage the best of both in-person and<br>remote work and to enable colleagues to have greater flexibility in their personal and professional lives.<br>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, around 20 percent of our U.S. workforce was virtual. Since we announced Amex Flex, the majority of<br>our colleagues in the U.S. have chosen hybrid schedules, opting to spend their time between in-office and virtual days, coming into<br>the office about one to three days per week, while more than 40 percent have opted to be fully virtual, a percentage that has doubled<br>over the last two years.<br>Our first office sites to adopt Amex Flex were in the U.S. and the UK in the first quarter of 2022.

<p>launching Healthy Minds a decade ago, we have continued to innovate and strengthen our program, and today, in addition to free<br>counseling for colleagues and their loved ones, we offer telehealth, grief and loss support, group drop-in sessions and mental health<br>trainings.</p>
<h16>Fostering Personal and Professional Growth</h16><p>At American Express, colleagues are continuously learning, growing and leading the way. We offer a range of relevant learning and<br>development opportunities with resources, feedback and support so colleagues can build meaningful careers that use their talents<br>and strengths to make an impact. All colleagues can build their skills, develop as leaders, pursue new areas of interest and gain<br>diverse experiences with access to programs like:</p>
<p>Feedback @ Amex—Seeking and Providing Coaching and Feedback is one of our Leadership Behaviors and is critical to colleague</p>
<p>growth and development. In 2021, we introduced a new company-wide program that provides more opportunities for coaching and<br>feedback, along with a suite of resources to help colleagues build their skills in these areas, including sample scenarios, tips for<br>mitigating unconscious bias when giving feedback, strategies for having meaningful conversations and more. We also provided a<br>leader-led feedback training, enabling individual teams to practice their feedback skills in an interactive group setting. All leaders are<br>strongly encouraged to host a session with their team. In advance of our annual Mid-Year and Year-End Performance and<br>Development Conversations, we also hosted enterprise-wide events to help both colleagues and leaders prepare to have effective<br>feedback conversations and ensure they knew the support available to learn and develop.<br>Our partnership with LinkedIn Learning gives colleagues quick and easy access to thousands of courses and videos taught by<br>industry experts on topics like business, leadership, technology, creativity and personal development. Colleagues can pick and<br>choose, receiving course recommendations based on their stated goals—or they can make use of curated “playlists” of on-demand<br>learning.<br>At the start of 2022, we launched Project MarketPlace, a new project-sharing enterprise platform where all colleagues can apply for<br>special, short-term projects (up to six months in duration) and explore different career areas and interests. The MarketPlace also<br>allows project leaders to diversify perspectives on their team and expand short-term resource capacity to get tasks done quickly and<br>effectively, all while honing their leadership skills. Colleagues at every level and within every business unit can access it and apply for<br>projects both within and outside their department.<br>The Accelerated Leadership Development Program equips high-potential Vice Presidents with the opportunity to strengthen their<br>leadership behaviors and move into complex roles across the enterprise. The experience includes instructor-led sessions with<br>external experts, speaker series with internal leaders, leadership assessments, mentorship and more.</p>

In addition, the review considered the advisability and the potential impact of selecting a different independent<br>registered public accounting firm. A wide range of internal stakeholders were surveyed and asked to comment generally, identify<br>areas for recognition and improvement and indicate how PwC’s performance was trending over time.

<h16>PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Fees and Services</h16><h20>Fees for 2022 and 2021</h20><p>The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed or to be billed by PwC for each of the last two fiscal years (in thousands):</p>
<p>Types of Fees 2022 2021</p>
<p>Audit Fees $29,835 $29,003</p>
<p>Audit-Related Fees</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>3,124 2,757</p>
<p>Tax Fees 1,235 1,200<br>All Other Fees 96 59
<br>TOTAL $34,290 $ 33,019
</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>PwC performs the audit of the Company’s pension plan for Hong Kong, where the fees are paid by the plan. These fees, which totaled $17K and $16K in 2022<br>and 2021, respectively, are not included in Audit-Related Fees since they were not paid by the Company.</p>
<p>In the table above, in accordance with SEC rules, “Audit Fees” consist of fees for professional services rendered for the integrated<br>audit of our consolidated financial statements, review of the interim consolidated financial statements included in quarterly reports,<br>and services provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements and other attest services. “Audit-Related<br>Fees” consist of fees for assurance and related services that were reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our<br>financial statements. The services included due diligence, internal control reviews, attest services not required by statute or<br>regulation and attest services for non-financial information, consultations on financial accounting and reporting matters not<br>classified as audit. “Tax Fees” consist of fees for professional services rendered for tax compliance and tax consulting services. “All<br>Other Fees” are fees for any services not included in the first three categories.</p>
<h20>Policy on Pre-Approval of Services Provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP</h20><p>The terms of our engagement of PwC are subject to the pre-approval of the Audit and Compliance Committee. All audit and<br>permitted non-audit services require pre-approval by the Audit and Compliance Committee in accordance with pre-approval<br>procedures established by the Audit and Compliance Committee. In accordance with SEC rules, the Audit and Compliance<br>Committee’s pre-approval procedures have two different approaches to pre-approving audit and permitted non-audit services<br>performed by PwC.<br>The Audit and Compliance Committee specifically pre-approves the terms and fees of the planned annual audit and permitted<br>non-audit services that are to be performed by PwC. Other proposed engagements may be pre-approved up to an aggregate fee<br>threshold, pursuant to procedures established by the Audit and Compliance Committee that are detailed as to the particular and<br>defined classes of services without consideration by the Audit and Compliance Committee of the specific case-by-case services to be<br>performed. We refer to this pre-approval method as “general pre-approval” and the Company’s Controller reports such pre-approved<br>engagements to the Audit and Compliance Committee at least quarterly.<br>The procedures also require all proposed engagements of PwC for services of any kind that have not received specific or general<br>pre-approval as described above to be approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee (or, should a time-sensitive need arise, its<br>Chair) prior to the beginning of any such services. All services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm have<br>been pre-approved in accordance with these procedures.<br>The Audit and Compliance Committee has reviewed the services performed by PwC and the related fees were consistent with the<br>maintenance of PwC’s independence.</p>
<h20>Other Transactions with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP</h20><p>We have a number of business relationships with individual member firms of the worldwide PwC organization. Our subsidiaries<br>provide card services to some of these firms and these firms pay fees to our subsidiaries. These services are in the normal course of<br>business, and we provide them pursuant to arrangements that we offer to other similar clients.</p>

<h16>Section 1: Executive Summary</h16><p>The executive compensation program has been designed to drive strong business performance and to align executive compensation<br>with long-term shareholder interests. A large portion of total compensation of our NEOs is at risk and directly tied to Company and<br>individual performance. The CD&amp;A that follows provides shareholders with information about the design of the compensation<br>programs, compensation decision-making process and our 2022 compensation decisions for our NEOs, including a Special Award<br>granted in October 2022 to certain executives, including Mr. Squeri.</p>
<h20>2022 Company Performance</h20><p>In 2022, we focused on expanding our leadership in the premium consumer space, building on our strong position in commercial<br>payments, strengthening our global integrated network to provide unique value, continuing to uplift our control and compliance<br>environment, and continuing to progress on our ESG goals. Our investments in product innovation, technology, people and our brand<br>drove Card Member engagement, acquisition and retention, as well as continued strong credit performance.<br>For 2022, the Compensation and Benefits Committee determined the Company’s overall performance to be above the goals<br>established in the Company’s annual performance scorecard and took this into consideration in determining annual incentives for<br>2022 (see pages 61-62 for additional details).<br>Business performance highlights in 2022 include:</p>

<p>FX-adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e.,</p>
<p>assumes 2022 foreign exchange rates apply to 2021 results and 2021 foreign exchange rates apply to 2020 results). Total revenues net of interest expense on an</p>
<p>FX-adjusted basis is a non-GAAP measure. See Annex A for a reconciliation. Management believes the presentation of information on an FX-adjusted basis is<br>helpful to investors by making it easier to compare the Company’s performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by</p>
<p>fluctuations in currency exchange rates.</p>

<p>leadership for the next several years and considered its importance to the Company’s growth plan. Based on this review, in October</p>
<p>2022, the Board and Compensation and Benefits Committee approved a Special Award of performance-based, non-qualified stock<br>options for certain executives, including Mr. Squeri.<br>This award, which is not intended to be recurring and is not part of the 2022 annual compensation outlined on page 57, was designed<br>to meet two key objectives:</p>

<h31>▪ The execution of our growth plan</h31><h31>▪ The continuing development of succession</h31><p>candidates</p>
<h26>Factors considered in designing the Special Award</h26><p>The Committee determined to provide this award as a supplement to our 2022 annual compensation program to further tie<br>compensation to Company performance while maintaining the market-aligned risk profile of annual compensation elements given<br>the objective of leadership continuity.<br>The Committee discussed the proposals across multiple meetings and considered the following in approving the Special Award:</p>
<h31>▪ The value expected to be generated for shareholders if the rigorous TSR growth hurdle is achieved</h31><h31>▪ The ability for the award to support sustained strong Company performance over the long-term</h31><h31>▪ Retaining leadership over the time horizon for the next stage of the Company’s growth plan</h31><h26>2022 Special Award Features</h26><p>40% absolute TSR growth</p>

<h29> 56 2023 PROXY STATEMENT</h29><h20>Pay Principles</h20><p>We believe our executive compensation program is thoughtful, consistent and continues to align with the Company’s business strategies.</p>
<p>We align pay with Company</p>
<p>performance</p>
<p>to support a long-term,</p>
<p>high-performance business</p>
<p>model.</p>
<p>We link the majority of pay to</p>
<p>long-term business strategies</p>
<p>and key priorities.</p>
<p>The CEO’s pay has added</p>
<p>emphasis on performance-based</p>
<p>incentives (95% of CEO’s pay)</p>
<p>with a substantial stock</p>
<p>ownership requirement.</p>
<p>We measure performance<br>against challenging goals,</p>
<p>including effective risk</p>
<p>management, established at the</p>
<p>start of each performance cycle</p>
<p>that are aligned with our key</p>
<p>business priorities.</p>
<p>We discourage</p>
<p>imprudent risk taking</p>
<p>by avoiding undue</p>
<p>emphasis on any one metric</p>
<p>or short-term goal.</p>
<p>We continue to review our pay principles with input from shareholders and regulators, including the Board of Governors of the<br>Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).</p>
<h20>Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant</h20><p>The Compensation and Benefits Committee is composed solely of independent directors. The Committee is responsible for<br>approving our executive officer compensation decisions. It has retained Semler Brossy Consulting Group (Semler Brossy) as its<br>independent compensation consultant to provide counsel on various compensation-related matters, including peer group selection<br>and competitive market assessment, market insights and trends in executive compensation and management’s proposed levels of<br>compensation. The Committee held six meetings over the course of 2022, all of which ended with executive sessions without<br>management present. During 2022, Semler Brossy attended Compensation and Benefits Committee and AENB Board meetings,<br>including executive sessions, and provided compensation advice independent of the Company’s management. Semler Brossy does<br>not engage in other work for the Company. The Committee assessed the independence of Semler Brossy pursuant to SEC rules and<br>concluded that their work did not raise any conflicts of interest.</p>
<h20>Say-on-Pay</h20><p>The Compensation and Benefits Committee values the input of our shareholders and we regularly engage<br>with them on executive compensation matters to foster a constructive dialogue on the programs and<br>decision-making process. The Compensation and Benefits Committee considers the long-term interests<br>of the Company and our shareholders when making decisions regarding our compensation program.</p>
<p>Following our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, we met with shareholders representing<br>approximately 33% of our outstanding shares and other constituents to discuss executive<br>compensation, corporate governance, ESG and related matters.<br>95.6% of the votes cast at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders favored our Say-on-Pay proposal.<br>The strong support for our compensation programs, reflected by our Say-on-Pay results, and our<br>shareholder engagement discussions influenced the Compensation and Benefits Committee’s<br>decision to continue the 2021 program design for 2022.</p>

<h29> 58 2023 PROXY STATEMENT</h29><h20>Base Salary</h20><p>Base salary is the fixed portion of total direct compensation for our executive officers, including the NEOs. Salaries are set at a level to</p>
<p>provide competitive fixed pay reflective of an executive’s role, responsibilities and individual performance. The Compensation and Benefits<br>Committee periodically reviews salaries as part of total compensation reviews; salary increases are not automatic or guaranteed.</p>
<h20>Annual Incentive Award (AIA)</h20><p>The AIA is structured to reflect specific and measurable Company goals, approved by the Compensation and Benefits Committee at<br>the beginning of the year, including key objectives in four categories: Shareholder, Customer, Colleague and Strategic. The<br>Committee believes each performance metric is a key driver of Company performance. To continue our focus on driving long-term<br>value for shareholders, in 2022, the weight of the Strategic quadrant of the Scorecard was increased while reducing the weight of the<br>Shareholder quadrant, which focuses on in-year financial performance.<br>The Committee uses the same Company Scorecard to determine annual incentives for all executives to promote an enterprise-wide<br>focus. The Company Scorecard is based on the following metrics:</p>

<h20>Peer Group and Benchmarking</h20><p>Our pay program is designed to reward achievement of financial and strategic goals and to attract, retain and motivate our leaders in<br>a competitive talent market. The Compensation and Benefits Committee periodically examines pay practices and pay data for a<br>Compensation Peer Group of 20 companies as a source of benchmarking data to better understand the competitiveness of our<br>compensation program and its various elements. While the benchmarking data is used to assess the competitiveness of our<br>compensation program, it is only one of a number of factors used to make final pay decisions. The Compensation Peer Group is<br>different than our LTIA Performance Peer Group which is selected for industry and financial metric comparability to assess our<br>relative financial performance in determining potential LTIA vesting.</p>
<h20>How We Select the Company’s Compensation Peer Group</h20><p>In selecting the current Compensation Peer Group, the Compensation and Benefits Committee identified prominent S&amp;P 500<br>companies, with revenue levels similar to ours, in the following categories: (1) financial institutions; (2) iconic global consumer<br>brands; and (3) payments and technology businesses.

<h16>Section 5: 2022 Compensation Decisions and Outcomes</h16><h20>2022 Annual Incentive Award</h20><h26>2022 Performance Multiplier – Company</h26><p>The Compensation and Benefits Committee evaluated the following results against the performance objectives approved for all NEOs</p>
<p>at the beginning of 2022. Goals approved at the start of the year were consistent with the full-year revenue and earnings per share<br>guidance that the Company provided publicly in January 2022. This guidance reflected continued revenue momentum and strong<br>credit performance, helping us to grow over a number of notable items that benefited our earnings in 2021, including sizeable credit<br>reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio. See our 2022 Annual Report on</p>
<p>Form 10-K for full discussion of financial performance. For each metric, the goals represent a measurement for a range of outcomes</p>
<p>that could result in a higher or lower payout. AIA payouts for 2022 performance occurred in February 2023.</p>
<p>The Compensation and Benefit Committee determined the Company’s overall performance outcomes across the Shareholder,<br>Customer, Colleague and Strategic measures to be above the 2022 annual goals established in the Company’s annual performance<br>scorecard and took this into consideration in determining the 2022 Company Performance Multiplier to be 150%. Company<br>performance outcomes the Committee took into consideration include:</p>
<h31>▪ Actual revenue growth and EPS outcomes exceeding the ambitious guidance communicated in January 2022</h31><h31>▪ Expanded leadership in the premium consumer space</h31><h31>▪ Strengthened leadership position in commercial payments</h31><h31>▪ Significant progress in expanding our global network</h31><h31>▪ Strong industry-leading credit performance</h31><h31>▪ Strong customer retention rates</h31><h31>▪ Outstanding progress in continuing to increase colleague engagement levels across all categories</h31><p>The following table provides further detail of Company performance in 2022, relative to the goals:</p>

<h29> 64 2023 PROXY STATEMENT</h29><h16>Other Compensation Decisions</h16><h20>Offer Letter – Ravikumar Radhakrishnan</h20><p>In January 2022, we hired Mr. Ravikumar Radhakrishnan as Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer (CIO). Mr.<br>Radhakrishnan has extensive, relevant experience to our Company having served as the CIO for Commercial Banking and Corporate<br>&amp; Investment Banking in addition to multiple other senior technology roles at Wells Fargo as well as prior experience in various<br>technology roles at Citigroup.<br>In order to provide a strong long-term incentive, to support a relocation from California to New York, and to reimburse<br>Mr. Radhakrishnan for compensation forfeited as a result of leaving Wells Fargo, the Compensation and Benefits Committee<br>negotiated an incentive-based compensation package commensurate with the compensation levels and target pay structures of<br>similarly situated executives. The Compensation and Benefits Committee considered the amount of the incentive compensation<br>forfeited by Mr. Radhakrishnan upon joining our Company and the vesting/payment timing of the forfeited amounts, as well as the<br>Compensation and Benefits Committee’s intent to provide a pay opportunity that promotes long-term Company performance.<br>In January 2022, Mr. Radhakrishnan received a Performance Equity Award of $3,650,000 as 2022 long-term incentive compensation<br>and also in consideration of Mr. Radhakrishnan’s forfeiture of his 2022 long-term incentive grant due to his resignation from Wells<br>Fargo. The performance terms of these awards are the same as the January 2022 grants for other NEOs to align his goals with those<br>of all executives to drive enterprise-wide growth. These incentive awards are subject to both performance targets and continued<br>employment, as well as subject to clawback under the Company’s Detrimental Conduct Policy.</p>
<h31>▪ 80% of this grant is in the form of Performance RSUs that vest based on the Company’s relative ROE and relative TSR</h31><p>performance over a 3-year period (January 2022 –December 2024) compared to LTIA performance peers.</p>
<h31>▪ The remaining 20% of the grant is in the form of stock options that vest subject to positive cumulative net income over a 3-year</h31><p>period January 2022 – December 2024).</p>
<h31>▪ Both awards vest in January 2025 subject to continued employment with the Company.</h31><p>The following awards were provided considering Mr. Radhakrishnan’s forfeited compensation with Wells Fargo:</p>
<h31>▪ Sign-On Equity Awards: The Company granted 22,591 RSUs, with a target value of $4,000,000 on January 28, 2022. The award</h31><p>vests in three installments, with 40% of grant vesting one year after the grant date, 30% after two years from the grant date and<br>the final 30% after three years from the grant date. Vesting of this award requires positive cumulative net income during the<br>respective vesting periods and continued employment through each of the vesting dates. These awards tie Mr. Radhakrishnan’s<br>compensation with shareholders’ interests because actual payout is impacted by the Company’s stock price performance over the<br>vesting period. This incentive award is subject to clawback under the Company’s Detrimental Conduct Policy.</p>
<h31>▪ Sign-On Cash Awards: The Company paid a total of $3,000,000 in sign-on cash compensation payable within 45 days from the</h31><p>commencement of employment contingent upon continued employment through the payment date.</p>

<p>2023 PROXY STATEMENT 65 </p>
<h16>Section 6: Compensation Policies and Practices</h16><h20>Discouraging Imprudent Risk Taking</h20><p>Our executive compensation program is:</p>
<p>Structured to provide a balance of cash and stock; annual and long-term incentives; and varied performance measures over<br>different time horizons;<br>Designed to encourage the proper level of risk taking consistent with our business model and strategies; and<br>Designed to be consistent with regulatory principles for safety and soundness.</p>
<p>The following policies and procedures help discourage imprudent risk taking:</p>
<h20>Discouraging Imprudent Risk Taking</h20><p>Cross-Section of</p>
<p>Metrics</p>
<p>We assess Company performance against a cross-section of key metrics and over multiple time frames to<br>discourage undue focus on short-term results or on any one metric and to reinforce risk balancing in<br>performance measurement. Our incentive plans are not overly leveraged (i.e., there is a cap on the maximum<br>payout).</p>
<p>Annual Risk Goals</p>
<p>Our Chief Risk Officer reviews goals for safety and soundness in relation to the Company’s risk appetite and sets<br>certain annual risk goals for the Company at the beginning of each year.</p>
<p>Monitoring of Risk</p>
<p>We continuously monitor relevant metrics, including credit risk and market risk metrics, performance against<br>our risk appetite thresholds as well as material operational risk events on a regular basis. We assign control and<br>compliance ratings to each business unit as part of our annual assessment of performance.</p>
<p>Adjustment of</p>
<p>Compensation</p>
<p>At year-end, our Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and certifies as to<br>whether actual results were achieved with proper risk governance and oversight and whether the Company<br>executed on its broad range of programs that help to avoid imprudent risk taking. The Chief Risk Officer issues a<br>year-end memorandum summarizing an overall assessment of the Company’s risk profile. If deemed necessary,<br>risk adjustments are made to Company annual incentive funding levels as well as to individual incentive awards.</p>
<p>Deferred Incentive</p>
<p>Compensation</p>
<p>At least 50% of total incentive compensation for executive officers is deferred for at least three years with<br>performance-based payout.</p>
<p>Performance</p>
<p>Based Vesting</p>
<p>Performance Restricted Stock Units are used in place of time-based RSUs for the Company’s senior colleagues.</p>
<p>Stock Ownership</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<p>We have robust stock ownership requirements for our CEO and other NEOs (as described below).</p>
<h20>Stock Ownership Guidelines</h20><p>Our current stock ownership guidelines require the CEO and our other NEOs to<br>own and maintain a substantial stake in the Company. The CEO and our other<br>NEOs are required to accumulate shares (i.e., shares owned outright, excluding<br>unvested/unearned shares and unexercised stock options) with a value<br>equivalent to a target multiple of their base salary and to retain 50% of the net<br>after-tax shares received upon vesting or exercise of their equity awards until<br>guidelines are met. The specific requirements are shown in the diagram.<br>As of December 31, 2022, all of our NEOs, except Mr. Radhakrishnan who was<br>hired in 2022, own more than their required target number of shares.</p>

<h29> 66 2023 PROXY STATEMENT</h29><h20>Clawback and Recoupment Policies</h20><p>We seek to recover, to the extent practicable, performance-based compensation from any executive officer and certain other<br>members of senior management under certain circumstances. The Company has two arrangements to clawback or cancel awards:</p>
<h31>▪ Detrimental Conduct Agreement</h31><h31>▪ Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy</h31><p>The table below outlines our policies:</p>
<p>Detrimental Conduct Agreement Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy</p>
<p>WHO</p>
<p>Approximately 1,500 colleagues at Vice President<br>level and above (including CEO)</p>
<p>All colleagues</p>
<p>WHEN</p>
<p>Colleague engages in detrimental conduct:</p>
<h31>▪ Working for a competitor (applies to approximately</h31><p>500 colleagues)</p>
<h31>▪ Soliciting American Express colleagues or customers</h31><h31>▪ Denigrating the Company in the media</h31><h31>▪ Engaging in certain misconduct that leads to</h31><p>termination</p>
<h31>▪ Misappropriation of confidential information or trade</h31><p>secrets</p>
<h31>▪ Other detrimental conduct categories (e.g., material</h31><p>violation of the Code of Conduct)</p>
<p>AXP financial results are restated:</p>
<h31>▪ Colleagues engaged in fraud or misconduct that</h31><p>caused or partially caused the need for the<br>restatement; and</p>
<h31>▪ Less compensation would have been paid to the</h31><p>colleagues based upon the restated financial results</p>
<p>WHAT</p>
<p>Forfeit unvested equity awards and repay the value<br>from Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP) awards<br>(including annual incentives for executive officers)<br>that vested in the last two years and dividends paid<br>on restricted stock</p>
<p>Company will seek to recover the difference between<br>the amount actually paid and what should have been<br>paid based on the restated financial results</p>
<p>In addition, the cash portion of the CEO’s AIA is subject to recoupment at the discretion of the Compensation and Benefits<br>Committee if the Company does not achieve acceptable performance in the following year.</p>
<h20>Perquisites</h20><p>We provide limited perquisites to support our objective to attract and retain talent for key positions, as well as to address security<br>concerns. For the CEO, the Company’s security policy requires him to use, for all travel purposes, to the maximum extent practicable,<br>the automobiles and aircraft provided by the Company for business travel. Our NEOs are also eligible to receive certain benefits<br>available to all other colleagues with a corporate card including Membership Reward points which are available for personal use. In<br>2022, the Company eliminated the annual cash perquisite allowance of $35,000 that was previously provided to executive officers of<br>the Company, including NEOs.</p>

<h20>Post-Employment Compensation</h20><h26>RETIREMENT BENEFITS</h26><p>NEOs receive retirement benefits through the following plans:</p>
<h31>▪ Retirement Savings Plan (RSP): A qualified 401(k) savings plan available to all eligible U.S. colleagues.</h31><h31>▪ Retirement Plan: A defined-benefit cash balance retirement plan for eligible U.S. colleagues. Benefit accruals were discontinued</h31><p>since 2007.</p>
<h31>▪ Retirement Restoration Plan (RRP): A U.S. non-qualified savings plan that makes up for RSP and Retirement Plan benefits that</h31><p>would otherwise be lost as a result of contribution limits for qualified plans under U.S. law.</p>
<h31>▪ Deferral Plan: Allows U.S. NEOs to defer a portion of their base salary and AIA payout. The annual deferral limit is equal to one</h31><p>times the NEO’s base salary.</p>
<p>NEO retirement benefits are more fully described under Retirement Plan Benefits on page 77 and under Non-Qualified Deferred<br>Compensation on pages 78-79.</p>
<h26>SEVERANCE: SENIOR EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN</h26><p>The Compensation and Benefits Committee must pre-approve severance for the Company’s executive officers. Under the Senior<br>Executive Severance Plan, NEOs who are terminated involuntarily for reasons that make them eligible for severance receive cash<br>severance benefits equal to one and one half years of base salary and target AIA. The Company also provides pro rata AIA payment<br>for the year of termination, calculated based on the number of days the NEO was employed during the calendar year prior to the<br>commencement of severance. Equity awards issued under the ICP continue to vest and certain benefits continue during the<br>severance period, unless the executive begins full-time, outside employment. U.S.-based NEOs who are age 65 or older are not<br>eligible for severance, unless the Compensation and Benefits Committee specifically approves severance for such an executive.<br>To protect shareholders and our business model, executives are required to comply with non-compete, non-solicitation,<br>confidentiality and non-denigration provisions during the period of time they are receiving severance. Our uniform severance plan<br>helps to avoid special treatment and provides an important enforcement mechanism for these protections.</p>
<h20>Tax Treatment</h20><p>Tax rules generally limit the deductibility of compensation paid to our NEOs to $1 million per year. The Compensation and Benefits<br>Committee maintains the flexibility to pay non-deductible incentive compensation.</p>

<p>The amounts in this column reflect AIA cash payments for annual performance. For Messrs. Campbell, Williams and Buckminster, the amount excludes the<br>portion of AIA that was made in the form of RSUs granted in February 2023 to comply with regulatory guidance that at least 50% of incentive compensation is<br>deferred. Payment of these RSUs is deferred for three years from the grant date, subject to positive cumulative net income performance but not to continued<br>employment. The amounts excluded (and awarded in RSUs) are as follows: Messrs. Campbell ($325,000), Williams ($237,500) and Buckminster ($300,000).<br>For Mr. Radhakrishnan, the 2022 amount also includes a sign-on cash payment of $3,000,000 made in accordance with his employment offer letter to replace<br>a portion of long-term incentives forfeited at his prior employer as a result of joining the Company.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Represents the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. Additional details on<br>accounting for stock-based compensation can be found in Note 10 Stock-Based Compensation, to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our<br>2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For Mr. Radhakrishnan, the 2022 amount in the Stock Awards column includes a $3,999,962 new hire equity award granted<br>in accordance with his employment offer letter to replace a portion of long-term incentives forfeited at his prior employer as a result of joining the Company.<br>For Messrs. Squeri and Williams, the 2022 amount in the Option Awards column includes the value of the 2022 Special Award.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>For each executive’s stock award, the maximum value as of the grant date, assuming the highest level of performance will be achieved and based on the<br>closing price of the Company’s common shares on the NYSE on the grant date, is as follows: Messrs. Squeri ($18,239,871), Campbell ($6,247,704), Williams<br>($5,805,266), Buckminster ($6,798,750) and Radhakrishnan ($7,503,838).</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>The amounts in this column reflect the cash payment made to the NEO in respect to a payout under the Portfolio Grant award program that was eliminated in<br>2019 and last paid out for the 2020 performance year. For the 2022 performance year, there were no other payouts in respect to non-equity incentive<br>compensation.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>The amounts in this column reflect the actuarial increase or decrease in the present value of the NEOs’ benefits under all defined benefit pension plans<br>established by the Company. The amounts reflect the impact of changes in interest rates and the NEOs’ changes in age during the year which are used to<br>measure the present value. Mr. Campbell and Mr. Radhakrishnan are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan due to their employment<br>commencement dates.</p>

<p>For Mr. Buckminster, who was on international assignment in London until June 2014, trailing tax equalization payments or reimbursements have been made<br>and recorded following the termination of his assignment in 2014 in order to address any foreign tax obligations relating to income received, awarded or<br>earned during his assignment. In 2022, American Express realized a foreign tax credit of approximately $936,000 relating to payments made by the Company<br>on Mr. Buckminster’s behalf in previous years. This amount was returned to the Company and is not reflected in the table above. For Mr. Radhakrishnan, the<br>amount shown in this column includes all tax payments/reimbursements in connection with his relocation from California to New York. These tax payments/<br>reimbursements are made under a program that applies to all similarly situated colleagues and is designed to facilitate relocations.</p>

<p>In 2022, the local travel allowance only applied to Mr. Squeri. The Company’s security policy requires the CEO to use for all travel purposes, to the maximum<br>extent practicable, the automobiles and aircraft provided by the Company to executives for business travel. The calculation of the incremental cost for<br>personal use of Company-owned automobiles and aircraft is based on the variable cost to the Company of operating the automobiles and aircraft and includes,<br>among other things, fuel costs, maintenance costs and, in the case of aircraft, the cost of trip-related crew hotels and meals and landing and ground handling<br>fees. The calculation does not include fixed costs that would have been incurred regardless of whether there was any personal use of the automobiles or<br>aircraft (e.g., purchase costs and depreciation, driver and flight crew fixed salaries and benefits, insurance costs, etc.).</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The CEO’s personal use of Company aircraft is limited to $200,000 per year and the CEO is required to reimburse the Company any incremental costs in<br>excess of $200,000 per year for travel on Company aircraft that is deemed by the SEC to be personal use.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>For Mr. Buckminster, the amounts shown include international tax and reporting services (not payments or reimbursements) in connection with his<br>repatriation to the U.S. due to trailing tax liabilities. The services provided to Mr. Buckminster are provided to all colleagues on international assignment. For<br>Mr. Radhakrishnan, the amount includes relocation reimbursements and payments, excluding tax payments. These payments were made in connection with<br>Mr. Radhakrishnan’s employment with American Express, which required that he relocate his residence from California to New York.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>This column reflects the aggregate amount of other perquisites and personal benefits provided, none of which individually exceeded the greater of $25,000 or<br>10% of the total amount of all perquisites and other personal benefits reported for the NEO. In 2022, other benefits consisted of office parking. We generally<br>incur no incremental cost for the provision of such additional benefits.</p>

<h20>1. 2023 Award types</h20><p>Annual Incentive Award (AIA): The AIA is an annual cash-denominated performance-based component of executive compensation.</p>
<p>Performance is measured against measurable goals and actual amounts paid are based on 2022 performance. Additional information<br>regarding how the payout amounts for these awards are determined is on page 58.</p>
<p>Stock Options (SO): Options have a ten-year term and 100% of these shares become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant</p>
<p>date, subject to continued employment and positive cumulative net income over the three-year vesting period. The exercise price of these<br>awards is the closing price of the Company’s common shares on the NYSE on the grant date.</p>
<p>Performance Stock Options (PSO): PSOs have a term of seven years, an exercise price equal to the closing price on the grant date and</p>
<p>vesting subject to (i) an absolute TSR goal of 40 percent above baseline TSR during the four-year period beginning on the grant date<br>(based on a 20 consecutive trading average price), (ii) a financial goal of positive cumulative net income for the four-year period, and<br>(iii) time-based service requirements (75% after 3 years, 25% after 4 years) assuming the performance conditions have been met. No<br>options may be exercised until the fourth anniversary of grant on October 31, 2026, and no later than the end of the seven-year term of<br>the options on October 31, 2029. Please see pages 53-54 for further detail.</p>
<p>Performance Restricted Stock Units (PRSU): These awards vest on the third anniversary of the grant date subject to continued</p>
<p>employment (with limited exceptions) and based on relative ROE and relative TSR performance during the performance period.<br>See page 59 for additional information on our Performance Restricted Stock Unit program.</p>
<p>Restricted Stock Units (RSU): For Messrs. Campbell, Williams and Buckminster, RSUs were granted in connection with their 2021 AIA</p>
<p>to comply with regulatory guidance. These RSUs are payable on the third anniversary of the grant date subject to positive cumulative net<br>income over 2022-2024 and are not subject to continued employment.<br>The 22,591 RSUs granted to Mr. Radhakrishnan are in connection with his sign-on equity awards. The award vests 40% on January 28,<br>2023, 30% on January 28, 2024, 30% on January 28, 2025, subject to positive cumulative net income and continued employment from<br>the grant date to each of the three vesting dates.</p>

<p>(1)</p>
<p>PVAB was determined using the same measurement date (December 31, 2022) and assumptions as used for financial reporting purposes:</p>
<h31>▪ Discount rate equal to 5.45%</h31><h31>▪ Pri-2012 Mortality Table projected with MP-2021 longevity improvements</h31><h31>▪ Retirement age is assumed to be the normal retirement age as defined in the plan (age 65)</h31><h31>▪ Form of payment is the value of the cash balance account payable as a lump-sum distribution upon retirement</h31><p>Retirement Plan: Messrs. Squeri, Williams and Buckminster participate in the Retirement Plan, which is a defined benefit cash</p>
<p>balance retirement plan for eligible U.S. colleagues. Benefit accruals were discontinued in the Retirement Plan since 2007, and the<br>Plan continues to credit participants with interest on their outstanding account balances. The Retirement Plan sets the interest rate<br>each year based on the average of the interest rates for certain five-year U.S. Treasury Notes, with a minimum interest rate of 5%.<br>The maximum interest rate is the lower of 10% or the applicable interest rate specified in the Retirement Plan. For 2022, the interest<br>rate is 5%.</p>
<p>RRP-Retirement Plan: Each RRP participant who participated in the Retirement Plan has a Retirement Plan-related account for</p>
<p>benefits that could not be provided under the Retirement Plan as a result of IRS limitations on tax-qualified plans. RRP-Retirement<br>Plan benefits accrued and vested in a similar manner to benefits under the Retirement Plan. Benefit accruals were discontinued in the<br>RRP-Retirement Plan since 2007, and the Plan continues to credit participants with interest on their outstanding account balances at<br>the same interest rate as the Retirement Plan. Participants may elect to receive payment of their RRP-Retirement Plan benefits in<br>either a lump sum or annual installments over a period of five, ten or fifteen consecutive years. Lump sum payments are made on or<br>about the January 1 or July 1 that is at least six months following the participant’s separation from service and installment payments<br>commence on or about the July 1 of the calendar year following the year in which the participant separates from service.</p>

<p>The amounts in this column are also included in the “All Other Compensation” table on page 70.</p>

<p>Earnings on RRP-RSP and Deferral Plan balances are determined based on hypothetical investment of those account balances at the direction of the<br>participant in the investment options available under the RSP (other than the self-directed brokerage account and the Company Stock Fund). In addition to the<br>investment options in the RSP, a Market Interest Rate option is available for pre-2011 Deferral Plan balances only. The Market Interest Rate option earns a rate<br>of return based on the SEC defined market rate for deferred compensation for the year, which is 120% of the long-term Applicable Federal Rate for December<br>of the preceding year. There are no above-market earnings for the Deferral Plan; therefore, no earnings are reported in the Summary Compensation Table.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Of the total amounts shown in this column, the following amounts have been reported as “Salary,” “Bonus” or “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” in<br>the Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement and prior years’ proxy statements: for Mr. Squeri, $6,896,321; for Mr. Campbell, $1,981,177; for<br>Mr. Williams, $923,639; for Mr. Buckminster, $3,359,890; and for Mr. Radhakrishnan, $31,250. The amounts in the preceding sentence do not include:<br>1) amounts deferred by each executive before becoming an NEO; and 2) amounts reported in prior years’ proxy statements as above-market earnings on<br>deferred compensation.</p>
<p>RSP: All U.S. active participants, including the NEOs, are immediately 100% vested in the Company matching contribution, which is</p>
<p>generally up to 6% of total pay (base pay and eligible incentive pay capped at one times base pay).<br>Prior to 2021, the Company made an annual discretionary profit sharing contribution for eligible U.S. colleagues based on the<br>Company’s performance for the year. Effective January 1, 2021, the Company started making an annual fixed rate contribution for<br>eligible U.S. colleagues. The fixed rate contribution is 2% of total pay for eligible U.S. manager-level colleagues and above (including<br>NEOs). Company fixed rate contributions and discretionary profit sharing contributions generally vest on the third anniversary of a<br>colleague’s service with the Company.<br>For Company colleagues who commenced their employment prior to April 1, 2007, an additional conversion contribution of up to 8%<br>of total pay was generally also contributed. The percentage was based on an individual’s projected age and service as of<br>December 31, 2008. Conversion contributions stopped at the end of 2017 for certain executives including the NEOs and stopped at<br>the end of 2018 for all other colleagues.</p>

<p>2023 PROXY STATEMENT 79 </p>
<p>RRP-RSP: Each RRP participant has a RRP-RSP account for benefits that cannot be provided under the RSP as a result of IRS</p>
<p>limitations on U.S. tax-qualified plans. The Company matches colleague contributions in the RRP-RSP account up to 6% of total pay<br>in excess of IRS compensation limits, only to the extent the colleague voluntarily defers compensation under the Company’s Non-<br>Qualified Deferral Plan. Conversion contributions in the RRP-RSP were stopped as described above for the RSP. Compensation for<br>RRP-RSP account purposes includes the same components of compensation as for the RSP, as well as the value of base pay and<br>annual cash incentive amounts deferred by a participant under the Non-Qualified Deferral Plan. Participants may elect to receive<br>payment of their RRP-RSP benefits in either a lump sum or annual installments over a period of five, ten or fifteen consecutive years.<br>Participants are allowed to make a one-time change to the form of payment for their RRP-RSP benefits so long as the change is made<br>at least one year before the participant’s separation from service and the payment commencement date is delayed by at least five<br>years. The payment election and any one-time change to the payment election apply to both the RRP-Retirement Plan and RRP-RSP<br>balances. New participants will have a default lump sum election for contributions attributable through the first full year of<br>participation, which is not subject to any one-time change.</p>
<p>Deferral Plan: As part of planning for retirement or other long-term financial needs, the Company provides the U.S. NEOs and certain</p>
<p>other senior level U.S. paid colleagues with an annual opportunity to defer a portion of their base salary or cash annual incentive<br>award up to one times their base salary. Under the Deferral Plan, certain participants may elect for payment to commence upon<br>separation from service or a specified date at least five years after deferral, but not later than separation from service, and to receive<br>payment in either a lump sum or annual installments over a period of five, ten or fifteen consecutive years. For 2007 and prior years,<br>participants were able to defer receipt until termination of employment or a specified date at least five years after deferral, but not<br>later than ten years after termination of employment.</p>
<p>Deferral Plan Earnings: Earnings for NEOs on Deferral Plan balances are based on investment options similar to those offered under</p>
<p>the RSP (other than the self-directed brokerage account and the Company Stock Fund). Furthermore, for participants, including<br>NEOs, with pre-2011 balances, the Deferral Plan allows for an additional investment option that provides a market interest rate based<br>on 120% of the long-term Applicable Federal Rate for December of the preceding year. Interest crediting on deferrals was previously<br>based on ROE-linked interest crediting schedules up until December 31, 2010.</p>

<h29> 80 2023 PROXY STATEMENT</h29><h16>Potential Payments Upon Termination or CIC</h16><p>The tables below show certain potential payments that would have been made to an NEO if the NEO’s employment had terminated on</p>
<p>December 31, 2022, under various scenarios, including a change in control (CIC). The tables do not include the pension benefits nor</p>
<p>non-qualified deferred compensation that would be paid to an NEO, which are set forth in the Pension Benefits 2022 and Non-Qualified<br>Deferred Compensation 2022 tables on the previous pages, except to the extent that the NEO is entitled to an additional benefit as a</p>
<p>result of the termination. In addition, the tables do not include the value of vested but unexercised SOs as of December 31, 2022. The</p>
<p>footnotes to the tables describe the assumptions used in estimating the amounts shown in the tables.</p>
<p>Because the payments to be made to an NEO depend on several factors, the actual amounts to be paid out upon an NEO’s<br>termination of employment can only be determined at the time of an executive’s actual separation from the Company. Additionally,<br>to protect shareholders and our business model, executives are required to comply with non-compete, non-solicitation and certain<br>other provisions during any period of time they receive severance.</p>

<p>2023 PROXY STATEMENT 83 </p>
<p>For all NEOs, in the event of death, disability, termination without cause not in connection with a change in control (CIC) and termination without cause or<br>constructive termination in connection with CIC, the table includes the incremental benefit that they would receive under these scenarios over and above what<br>they would otherwise receive upon retirement or voluntary resignation.<br>Upon Voluntary Resignation or Retirement, Messrs. Campbell, Williams and Buckminster are eligible to receive RSUs granted in lieu of AIA subject to positive<br>cumulative net income.<br>Messrs. Squeri and Williams received the 2022 Special Award in October 2022 that are subject to the conditions outlined on pages 53-54. As of December 31,<br>2022, the performance and time conditions for the award to vest have not been met and therefore in the event of resignation, retirement, death, disability,<br>termination without cause not in connection with CIC, or termination without cause or constructive termination in connection with CIC, Messrs. Squeri and<br>Williams would forfeit all unvested PSOs under this award.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Severance reflects one and a half years of base salary and target AIA. The sum of these two numbers is paid out in equal installments over one and a half years.<br>This treatment is applicable to termination without cause not in connection with CIC and termination without cause or constructive termination in connection<br>with CIC under the Senior Executive Severance Plan.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Value of LTIA: PRSU, RSU and SO values are based on a share price of $147.75, the closing price per share of our common stock as of December 31, 2022. For<br>PRSUs, the value reflects the target value. For SOs, the value reflects the “in the money” value of SOs that would vest upon termination of employment or<br>termination following CIC. Messrs. Squeri and Buckminster are full retirement eligible and therefore eligible for continued vesting of outstanding LTIA upon<br>retirement subject to applicable performance, with the exception of the 2022 Special Award.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Deferred Compensation: Reflects one and a half years of additional interest crediting (using the prior year’s interest rate assuming 1.58% for 1994 – 2004<br>programs) on the grandfathered amounts (amounts that were earned and vested on or prior to December 31, 2004). Grandfathered amounts are paid out at<br>the end of the one and a half years severance period in the form elected by the NEO.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Retirement Savings Plan: Upon disability, reflects future Company contributions in the RSP through age 65.</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>Other Benefits: For all NEOs, includes the payment of unused accrued vacation for the calendar year. Under our Key Executive Life Insurance Plan, for Messrs.<br>Squeri and Buckminster, approximately $4,772 and $3,935, respectively, is for the cash surrender value and approximately $527,353 and $630,186,<br>respectively, is the projected lump-sum payment related to life insurance. For all NEOs, under termination without cause not in connection with CIC and under<br>termination without cause or constructive termination in connection with CIC, reflects one and a half years of contributions to U.S. medical, dental, health<br>savings accounts and premiums, if applicable, under the basic and post-2003 Key Executive Life Insurance Plans and outplacement services.</p>

<h16>Pay Ratio</h16><h26>CEO Pay Ratio</h26><p>In accordance with SEC rules, this year we identified a new median compensated employee as the last median employee was<br>identified for our 2020 disclosure.<br>Our CEO to median compensated employee pay ratio is 972:1. This reflects Mr. Squeri’s compensation as reported in the 2022<br>Summary Compensation Table of $48,029,631, which includes the 2022 Special Award, and the equivalent annual total<br>compensation for the identified median compensated employee of $49,409.<br>The change in median compensated employee is a result of approximately 20% growth in our number of colleagues since 2020. This<br>growth has been predominantly within our junior front-line roles in geographies where compensation rates are lower relative to the<br>U.S. The Company has continued to invest significantly in its talent, including pay equity, as outlined in “Environmental, Social and<br>Governance (ESG)” starting on page 37 of this proxy statement.</p>
<h26>CEO Pay Ratio without Special Award</h26><p>Because the 2022 Special Award is not part of Mr. Squeri’s annual compensation, we are presenting an alternative pay ratio<br>calculation that excludes this award granted in October 2022 with a grant date fair value of $14,999,990. Excluding this award,<br>Mr. Squeri’s compensation would have been approximately $33,000,000 and the resulting pay ratio would have been 668:1.</p>
<h26>Median Total Annual Compensation Methodology</h26><p>To determine our median compensated employee, we reviewed our worldwide colleague population, consisting of approximately</p>
<p>26,000 U.S. colleagues and 50,300 non-U.S. colleagues, excluding our CEO, who were employed as of November 30, 2022. As our</p>
<p>non-U.S. colleagues exceed 5% of our worldwide colleague population, we applied the de minimis exception to exclude non-U.S.<br>colleagues in certain jurisdictions that were not representative of our worldwide colleague population across various job levels.* As a</p>
<p>result, our median compensated employee determination includes approximately 74,400 permanent Company employees, whether</p>
<p>full-time or part-time, which represents approximately 97.5% of our worldwide colleague population as of November 30, 2022.</p>
<p>To identify our median compensated employee from the selected colleague population, we used base salary or wages plus overtime<br>pay as of November 30, 2022, as well as annual bonus, long-term incentive awards and one-time payments for 2022, as the most<br>appropriate measure of compensation. We used annualized base salary compensation for colleagues that were newly hired in 2022,<br>and we did not make any cost-of-living adjustments.</p>

<p>To calculate the annual total compensation for our median compensated employee, we used a consistent methodology as used for<br>the 2022 Summary Compensation Table. As our median compensated employee is located outside the U.S., the annual total<br>compensation was converted into U.S. dollars using the average daily exchange rate for the month of December 2022. We did not<br>make any other assumptions or estimates with respect to annual total compensation.</p>

<p>Fair value or change in fair value, as applicable, of equity awards in the “Compensation Actually Paid” columns was determined by reference to:</p>
<h31>▪ For RSU awards (excluding performance based RSUs), closing price on applicable year-end date(s) or, in the case of vesting dates, the actual vesting</h31><p>price.</p>
<h31>▪ For PRSUs awarded prior to 2019 (which included an absolute ROE performance condition only), the same valuation methodology as RSU awards above</h31><p>except year-end values are multiplied times estimate of probable achievement as of each such date or, in the case of vesting awards, the actual vesting<br>price and outcome.</p>
<h31>▪ For 2022 Special Award PSOs and for PRSUs awarded from 2019 onwards (which includes a relative TSR performance condition in addition to relative</h31><p>ROE as outlined on page 59), the fair value was calculated by a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the applicable year-end date(s) multiplied times<br>estimate of probable achievement as of each such date, or, in the case of vesting awards, the actual vesting price and outcome.</p>
<h31>▪ For stock options, a Black Scholes value as of the applicable year-end or vesting date(s), determined based on the same methodology as used to</h31><p>determine grant date fair value but using the closing stock price on the applicable revaluation date as the current market price and with an expected term<br>set using an elapsed term approach. This approach calculates expected term by subtracting the amount of time that has elapsed (between the grant and<br>subsequent valuation dates) from the initial grant-date expected term estimate. Volatility (based on both historical and implied volatilities), risk free rates<br>and dividend yield are determined as of revaluation date based on the expected term.</p>

At the Company’s 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders voted on our say-on-frequency proposal<br>indicating a preference for holding such vote every year. Accordingly, the Board decided that the non-binding vote to approve the<br>compensation of the Company’s NEOs would be held every year, at least until the next non-binding shareholder vote on the<br>frequency with which the non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of the Company’s NEOs shall be held. The Board<br>believes an annual advisory vote on executive compensation continues to be the best approach for the Company. In making this</p>
<p>recommendation for an annual advisory vote on executive compensation, the Board considered that an annual Say-on-Pay vote</p>

<h6>Shareholder Proposals</h6>
<h13>Our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST</h13><h9>each shareholder proposal (Items 5-6).</h9><p>Shareholders will vote on the following shareholder proposals (Items 5 and 6), if properly presented at the 2023 Annual Meeting and<br>if not properly withdrawn or excluded. The shareholder proposals and supporting statements appear in the form in which we received<br>them and may contain assertions about the Company that are incorrect or inaccurate. We make every effort to meet and engage with<br>shareholders and investors. We have met with each of the shareholder proponents to discuss their respective proposals and after our<br>engagement, our Board recommends a vote AGAINST these shareholder proposals.</p>
<h16>Item 5: Shareholder Proposal Relating to Termination Pay</h16><h13>Our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST</h13><h13>this proposal.</h13><p>Kenneth Steiner, 14 Stoner Ave., Apt. 2M, Great Neck, NY, has advised that he is the owner of not less than 500 common shares and<br>he intends for Mr. John Chevedden to introduce the following proposal on his behalf.</p>
<h16>Proposal 5 — Shareholder Ratification of Excessive Termination Pay</h16><p>Shareholders request that the Board seek shareholder approval of any senior manager’s new or renewed pay package that provides<br>for severance or termination payments with an estimated value exceeding 2.99 times the sum of the executive’s base salary plus<br>target short-term bonus.</p>
<p>“Severance or termination payments” include cash, equity or other pay that is paid out or vests due to a senior executive’s termination for<br>any reason. Payments include those provided under employment agreements, severance plans, and change-in-control clauses in long-<br>term equity plans, but not life insurance, pension benefits, or deferred pay earned and vested prior to termination.</p>
<p>“Estimated total value” includes: lump-sum payments; payments offsetting tax. liabilities, perquisites or benefits not vested under a<br>plan generally available to management employees, post-employment consulting fees or office expense and equity awards if vesting<br>is accelerated, or a performance condition waived, due to termination.<br>The Board shall retain the option to seek shareholder approval after material terms are agreed upon.</p>
<p>Generous performance-based pay can sometimes be justified but shareholder ratification of “golden parachute” severance packages with</p>
<p>a total cost exceeding 2.99 times base salary plus target short-term bonus better aligns management pay with shareholder interests.</p>
<p>Shareholder Ratification of Excessive Termination Pay, the topic of this proposal, received between 51% and 65% support at:</p>
<p>AbbVie (ABBV)</p>
<p>FedEx (FDX)<br>Spirit AeroSystems (SPR)<br>Alaska Air (ALK)<br>Fiserv (FISV)</p>
<p>This proposal is more important at American Express because the Board seems to have exercised poor judgment in naming Mr. Thomas<br>Baltimore to the AXP board in 2021. Mr. Baltimore was rejected by 33% of shares at Prudential Financial in 2019 and 2020 and then</p>
<p>rejected by 30% of shares in 2022. Serious consideration should be given to keeping Mr. Baltimore off of any AXP Board Committee.</p>

<h29> 92 2023 PROXY STATEMENT</h29><h16>Board of Directors Statement in Opposition</h16><p>Our Board and its Compensation and Benefits Committee and its Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee have<br>considered this proposal and concluded that its adoption is not in the best interests of the Company or our shareholders. Our Board<br>recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal because:</p>
<h31>▪ The proposal is unnecessary because the Company’s current severance plan already limits cash severance payments to 1.0 or 1.5</h31><p>times the sum of the executive’s base salary plus target annual bonus, which is well below 2.99 times base salary plus target annual<br>bonus.</p>
<h31>▪ Payments to terminated executives under our equity compensation plan are also subject to reasonable and appropriate limits.</h31><h31>▪ Shareholders already have a voice on executive pay through the annual Say-on-Pay vote.</h31><h31>▪ The proposal would hamper the Company’s flexibility with respect to attracting and retaining talent, placing it at a competitive</h31><p>disadvantage to companies and competitors not subject to a similar shareholder approval requirement.</p>
<p>The Company’s existing severance plan already limits cash severance pay for executives to below 2.99 base pay plus target<br>annual cash bonus.</p>
<p>The American Express Company Senior Executive Severance Plan (Severance Plan), which applies to all senior executives (Senior<br>Vice President and above level) globally, is designed to provide executives with reasonable compensation if their employment is<br>terminated for qualifying reasons. Qualifying terminations generally include terminations without cause, job elimination, and<br>involuntary or constructive terminations within two years following a change in control (CIC); a termination for cause or a voluntary<br>retirement are not severance qualifying terminations. Our Severance Plan already limits cash severance payments to 1.0 or 1.5<br>(depending on seniority) times the sum of the executive’s base salary plus target annual bonus, which is paid over 12 or 18 months,<br>respectively. A terminated executive is also eligible to receive a pro-rata portion of the target annual bonus for the year of termination<br>based on the number of days the executive was actively employed in that year. Additionally, the Severance Plan restricts any paid<br>notice period to 90 days. Because the Severance Plan already limits cash severance to below 2.99 base salary plus target annual<br>bonus, the consent requirement contained within the shareholder proposal is unnecessary.<br>While receiving severance pay, our senior executives continue to receive certain reasonable employee benefits, such as participation<br>in our medical and life insurance programs so long as they have not secured full-time employment. Similarly, our senior executives<br>continue to vest in their outstanding equity awards and their already vested stock options remain exercisable (subject to applicable<br>expiration dates) while they are receiving severance benefits as if they remained actively employed, and subject to applicable<br>performance-vesting conditions.<br>In order to receive any benefits under our Severance Plan, the executive must sign a severance agreement that includes a release of<br>claims, as well as certain restrictive covenants (confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and non-denigration). If an<br>executive violates the severance agreement, including a breach of the restrictive covenants, further severance and benefits and<br>outstanding unvested equity awards are forfeited and 95% of the value of previously paid severance, benefits, and the equity awards<br>that vested during the separation period must be repaid to the Company.<br>Finally, under the Company’s annual bonus program, in the event of death, the beneficiary of a senior executive may be entitled to<br>receive a pro-rata portion of the deceased executive’s target annual bonus for the year of death, in order to address the financial<br>impacts that may be associated with the senior executive’s death. And in the event of an eligible termination of one of our most<br>senior executives within the two-year period following a CIC (a “double trigger” termination), such executive is entitled to payment of<br>the annual bonus for the year of termination based on the average annual bonus received in the two preceding years.<br>Given that the Company’s existing severance plan already limits cash severance pay for executives to 1.0 or 1.5 times the sum of the<br>executive’s base salary plus target annual bonus, which is well below 2.99 base pay plus annual target bonus, and includes limits that<br>our Board believes are reasonable and appropriate, the proposal is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Payments to terminated executives under our equity compensation plan are also subject to reasonable and appropriate limits.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the terms of our equity compensation plan, our senior executives generally continue to vest in granted outstanding equity<br>awards following full retirement, and in their equity awards that have been outstanding over one year following early retirement, as if</p>
<p>they remained actively employed, and in each case, subject to applicable performance-vesting conditions. As detailed on page 82 of<br>this proxy statement, the vesting of equity awards is immediate in the event of death or termination due to disability, which is intended<br>to address the devastating financial impact that a death or disability can have on a senior executive’s family.</p>

<p>2023 PROXY STATEMENT 93 </p>
<p>Shareholders already have a voice on executive pay through the annual Say-on-Pay vote.</p>
<p>Existing governance over the plans providing for post-termination payments further underscore that the proposal’s shareholder<br>approval requirement is unnecessary. Our existing plans and policies governing post-employment compensation for executives are<br>described under “Post-Employment Compensation—Severance: Senior Executive Severance Policy,” and shareholders have the<br>opportunity to address those practices through our annual Say-on-Pay vote. In addition, in the event of any merger, acquisition or<br>other similar event, shareholders would have a further opportunity to express their views on any compensation to our executives in<br>connection with that transaction (including the CIC provisions). Additional voting on severance payments is unnecessary.</p>
<p>The proposal could impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain executive talent, placing us at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>The Company operates a global enterprise in a highly competitive business environment. We compete for talented executives with<br>some of the world’s largest companies, across a number of business sectors. Our global recognition and reputation for excellence in<br>management and leadership make our executives attractive targets for other companies, and our executives are aggressively<br>recruited. As part of our focus on attracting and retaining key talent, we maintain a comprehensive compensation program, an<br>important component of which is the principled use of long-term equity awards. Long term equity awards are an effective way to<br>tether executive compensation to maximizing long-term shareholder value and, therefore, are commonly used by the employers with<br>whom we compete for talent. A requirement to call a special meeting of shareholders to obtain prior approval of a severance<br>arrangement that would provide benefits in excess of the specified cap could severely disadvantage the Company’s ability to recruit<br>qualified executives.<br>We are often called upon to negotiate compensation terms with potential new hires, as well as existing executives who are<br>considering competing job offers. Those negotiations often concern the types of termination payments contemplated by the<br>proposal such as retention packages, and sign-on/make-whole terms that replace compensation a potential new hire will forfeit by<br>joining American Express. Requiring shareholder approval before committing to those terms will result in significant delays,<br>effectively precluding the Company from quickly and thoughtfully negotiating with and securing talent. The shareholder approval<br>requirement would also infuse an element of uncertainty as to our ability to finalize terms with potential new hires and existing<br>executives we are striving to retain. The proposal would not only require shareholder approval in order for our executives to continue<br>to vest in the full value of their equity awards upon a severance event, but presumably in the event of death, disability or even<br>retirement.<br>The combination of making it more difficult for the Company to secure our existing talent while at the same time also substantially<br>hindering our ability to hire new executive talent could create significant gaps in our executive talent ranks. The proposal’s negative<br>impact on our ability to compete for executive talent is therefore antithetical to the best interests of our shareholders.</p>
<h16>Board Recommendation</h16><p>In summary, our Board believes that our current executive compensation policies and practices, including our plans and policies<br>governing post-employment compensation, are reasonable, appropriate and effectively align the interests of our executives with<br>those of our shareholders. As fully disclosed in our proxy statement, our existing policies already provide reasonable and appropriate<br>governance and limits with respect to post-employment executive compensation. These policies and practices are aligned to external<br>market practice, including but not limited to a limit on cash severance payments that is below 2.99 times base salary plus annual<br>bonus and shareholder approval of our incentive compensation plan under which long term equity awards are issued.<br>Adoption of this proposal could prevent us from effectively recruiting, incentivizing and retaining critical talent, and therefore would<br>not be in the best interests of our shareholders or the Company. For the reasons described above, our Board recommends that you<br>vote AGAINST this proposal.</p>

<h29> 94 2023 PROXY STATEMENT</h29><h16>Item 6: Shareholder Proposal Relating to Abortion &amp; Consumer Data</h16><h16>Privacy</h16><h13>Our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST</h13><h13>this proposal.</h13><p>Change Finance P.B.C. has advised us that it intends to introduce the following shareholder proposal.</p>
<h16>Proposal 6 — Abortion &amp; Consumer Data Privacy</h16><p>WHEREAS: Following the revocation of the constitutional right to an abortion in June 2022, policymakers and legislators have</p>
<p>become alarmed by the use of personal digital data for the enforcement of state laws that ban or limit abortion access. Congress is<br>considering bills that would increase privacy protections for personal reproductive health information. California now requires<br>out-of-state law enforcement seeking personal data from California corporations to attest that the investigation does not involve any<br>crime related to an abortion that is lawful under California law.<br>Law enforcement frequently relies on digital consumer data. While American Express does not publicly report figures on its<br>compliance with law enforcement requests, Alphabet and Meta alone collectively received around 110,000 requests in the second<br>half of 2021, and each complied with about 80% of those requests. In 2022, Meta satisfied a Nebraska police warrant for private<br>Facebook messages from a defendant facing felony charges for allegedly helping her daughter terminate a pregnancy.<br>Financial institutions collect sensitive personal information such as geolocation data, browsing history and financial activity. There is<br>reason for concern that such data will be accessed without consumer consent by states that criminalize abortion. Indeed, the<br>American Express Privacy Statement declares that the Company “may share [p]ersonal [i]nformation as require[d] or as permitted<br>by law, with . . . governmental agencies to comply with . . . government requests.” However, such law enforcement requests may seek<br>evidence of consumer acts that are inappropriate for the bank to voluntarily share—for example, evidence of a customer’s financial<br>activities that were legal in the state where they occurred, such as purchasing abortion pills.<br>Since American Express collects and stores digital consumer data, the Company is not immune to abortion-related law enforcement<br>requests that may create significant reputational, financial, and legal risks. American Express is already complying with “deletion<br>rights’’ under California law, wherein consumers may request that the Company delete collected personal data that is not legally<br>required to retain. Accordingly, there is a strong market benefit to upholding and increasing longstanding consumer privacy<br>expectations.</p>
<p>RESOLVED: Shareholders request that our Board issue a public report detailing any known and potential risks and costs to the</p>
<p>Company of fulfilling information requests regarding American Express customers for the enforcement of state laws criminalizing<br>abortion access, and setting forth any strategies beyond legal compliance that the Company may deploy to minimize or mitigate<br>these risks.<br>The report should be produced at reasonable expense, exclude proprietary or legally privileged information, and be published no later<br>than September 1, 2024.</p>
<p>SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Shareholders recommend that the report, in the discretion of board and management, should:</p>
<p>1. Consider the implementation of a data privacy policy wherein consumers nationwide would have “deletion rights,” and would</p>
<p>be notified by the Company about any law enforcement information requests regarding their data prior to complying with<br>any such request; and,</p>
<p>2. Reflect the input or participation of reproductive rights and civil liberties organizations.</p>

<p>2023 PROXY STATEMENT 95 </p>
<h16>Board of Directors Statement in Opposition</h16><p>Our Board and its Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility Committee have considered this proposal and concluded that<br>its adoption is not in the best interests of the Company or our shareholders. Our Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal as<br>it believes such a report is unnecessary because:</p>
<h31>▪ Information on the Company’s data management practices is readily accessible on the American Express website and in certain of</h31><p>its public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h31>▪ Because of the limitations of global payment processing networks, the Company receives limited information about what products</h31><p>and services customers are purchasing with their cards.</p>
<h31>▪ The Company is required to comply with laws that apply to its operations, including requests for information from law enforcement</h31><p>and regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>American Express Data Privacy</p>
<p>The Company has a longstanding commitment to transparency as it relates to its customers’ privacy. The Company’s robust data<br>privacy program outlines which information it may collect and how its customers may manage their own data privacy preferences.<br>The Company’s Online Privacy Statement provides clarity on:</p>
<h31>▪ What personal information the Company collects and how it is collected;</h31><h31>▪ How the Company uses the personal information collected;</h31><h31>▪ How the Company shares personal information;</h31><h31>▪ How the Company keeps and safeguards personal information; and</h31><h31>▪ What a customer’s choices are with respect to personal information.</h31><p>The Company will only process personal data that is necessary to provide products and services to its customers and will only do so<br>by lawful and fair means. The Company may collect data from a customer in three ways: (i) the customer gives the Company data<br>directly by signing up for products and services; (ii) when a customer uses the Company’s website and app or their American Express<br>card for everyday purchases; and (iii) publicly available information like data from online platforms or databases.<br>The Company only shares personal data with third parties where it is necessary to:</p>
<h31>▪ provide customers with products or services or as part of the nature of its relationship with them;</h31><h31>▪ where the Company has previously informed or been authorized to do so by a customer;</h31><h31>▪ in connection with its efforts to reduce fraud; or</h31><h31>▪ as permitted by law.</h31><p>Independent of specific regulatory requirements, the Company has an obligation to only collect, use or share personal information<br>when it has a legitimate business need to do so. Information on the Company’s operational risk management processes, including<br>privacy and data management and governance, is available in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.</p>
<p>Transactional Information</p>
<p>Because of the limited data available through the global payment processing networks, the Company does not have access to the<br>transaction information assumed by the shareholder proposal. The information that the Company has access to as a payments<br>network when a customer makes a purchase with their card is generally limited to the monetary amount of the transactions and the<br>merchant where the transaction occurred. The Company does not have information about what a customer is purchasing with their<br>cards. The Company does not receive product level, or Stock Keeping Unit (SKU)-level, data about the actual goods or services a<br>customer obtains with their card. For example, when a customer uses their card to make a purchase at a grocery store, the Company<br>does not know whether that customer purchased a gallon of milk, laundry detergent or some other item.<br>In the context of health care, the Company’s spending data does not include information about specific medical products, services or<br>procedures provided at healthcare facilities, and the Company would not be able to identify any products, services or procedures a<br>customer obtained while utilizing their card at any such healthcare facility. Because the Company does not receive information about<br>the products or services a customer purchases with their card, transaction data does not include such details.</p>

<h29> 96 2023 PROXY STATEMENT</h29><p>Deletion Rights</p>
<p>As a federal banking institution, the Company is covered by federal law, specifically the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). As such, the<br>Company is exempt from the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for any customer relationships involving personal American<br>Express cards and products. However, the Company has complied with the CCPA to provide eligible California residents with greater<br>access, awareness and control over their personal information. Eligible California residents include American Express business<br>customers and prospects; consumer prospects; and current and former colleagues, contractors and job applicants. The Company<br>provides these California residents with the ability to know how we collect, use and disclose their personal information, as well as<br>provide them the right to access and delete their personal information, subject to certain exceptions. The personal information of<br>American Express consumer customers who are California residents will continue to be governed by the GLBA, the federal law that<br>outlines financial institutions’ responsibilities for protecting a customer’s non-public personal information (NPI). NPI is any<br>information collected or derived from providing a financial product or service to a customer or applicant, including digital information<br>such as cookies and IP address. The rights afforded to California residents in the CCPA explicitly do not apply to NPI.<br>We only honor deletion rights requests from California-based customers when there is no business justification for retaining the data<br>or we are no longer required by law to retain it. The law requires the Company to retain data for a variety of reasons, including fraud<br>prevention and anti-money laundering. Therefore, the Company cannot delete these records until the retention period ends. This is a<br>common approach taken by federally regulated banking institutions.</p>
<p>Data Sharing</p>
<p>The Company’s privacy policies, summarized above and readily accessible on its website, define and govern how and when we share<br>customer data. The Company uses collected personal data to conduct research and analysis to improve a customer’s experiences<br>offline and online, as well as in connection with servicing customer accounts and marketing its own products, the latter of which<br>customers have the ability to control. Additionally, the Company may use data to further improve security, prevent and manage fraud<br>on a customer’s account, and assess credit risks related to its business.<br>As it relates to legal and regulatory matters, the Company complies with applicable laws, including requests for information from law<br>enforcement and regulatory agencies that we may receive in the form of a court-ordered subpoena or other information access<br>request. The Company generally does not provide customers’ information to law enforcement or regulatory agencies in the absence<br>of a subpoena, exigent circumstances or where the Company is the victim of a crime. Failure to comply with lawfully issued orders for<br>information from such agencies may result in sanctions or other penalties.<br>The Company complies with the Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA), a federal law that restricts a federal government authority’s<br>ability to access financial records of a customer except under certain circumstances. The RFPA:</p>
<h31>▪ requires the federal government authority to notify customers of their requests for financial records unless a statutory exception</h31><p>applies;</p>
<h31>▪ requires financial institutions to obtain a certificate of compliance from the federal government authority which states it has</h31><p>complied with the RFPA’s customer notice requirements before releasing financial records; and</p>
<h31>▪ allows for a customer to authorize disclosure by the financial institution of their records.</h31><p>Exemptions to these requirements include grand jury subpoenas, which we are legally prohibited from notifying customers about,<br>and federal civil and criminal procedures in which a government authority and the customer are parties to the litigation.<br>In most cases, the reason why a law enforcement agency or regulator may be requesting certain information is not shared with us.<br>That means the Company would not know the nature of any particular investigation an agency is conducting or what activities they<br>may be reviewing. They are not required to provide such information and may be legally prohibited from sharing such details.<br>Additionally, in certain instances we are legally prohibited from notifying customers about subpoenas or other legal requests when<br>there is a confidentiality requirement.</p>
<h16>Board Recommendation</h16><p>In summary, our Board believes that the implementation of this shareholder proposal is not in the best interests of the shareholders<br>or the Company and is unnecessary, given the ability of shareholders to access the Company’s data management and risk<br>management functions in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, the fact that the Company does not receive<br>or have access to data about specific products and services customers use their cards to purchase, which would make it unable to<br>provide the report requested even if the proposal passed, and given that the Company generally does not provide customers’<br>information to law enforcement or regulatory agencies in the absence of a subpoena, exigent circumstances or where the Company<br>is the victim of a crime. For the reasons described above, our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal.</p>

<h6>Stock Ownership Information</h6>
<p>The table below shows how many American Express Company common shares certain individuals and entities beneficially owned on<br>March 6, 2023, except as noted. These individuals and entities include: (1) owners of more than 5% of our outstanding common<br>shares; (2) our current directors and nominees; (3) the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table on page 69;<br>and (4) all current directors, nominees and executive officers as a group. A person has beneficial ownership of shares if the person<br>has voting or investment power over the shares or the right to acquire such power within 60 days. Investment power means the<br>power to direct the sale or other disposition of the shares. Each person has sole voting and investment power over the shares, except<br>as we describe below. The “Number of Shares Owned” column does not include restricted stock units granted to executive officers or<br>SEUs owned by directors because they are not beneficially owned under SEC rules. The SEUs credited to the directors’ accounts as<br>of December 31, 2022 are shown in the last column in the table below.</p>

We currently plan to<br>conduct the meeting in person at our offices at 200 Vesey Street, New York, New York 10285, but as the COVID-19 pandemic and the<br>public health response to it continue to evolve, we may decide to hold the meeting in a different location or solely by means of remote<br>communication (i.e., a virtual-only meeting). We continue to be mindful of the public health concerns posed by the COVID-19<br>pandemic. In-person attendance will require compliance with protocols consistent with then applicable federal, state and local<br>guidelines, mandates or recommendations, as well as with requirements imposed by our building.

<p>2023 PROXY STATEMENT 101 </p>
<h26>How to Cast Your Vote</h26><p>You may vote common shares that you owned as of the close of business on March 6, 2023, which is the record date for the meeting.<br>We encourage you to vote as soon as possible, even if you plan to attend the meeting. Please follow the instructions on your proxy<br>card, voting instruction form or on the notice of internet availability of proxy materials that you received. If you submit your vote prior<br>to the meeting, you may still attend the meeting and vote at the meeting.<br>You may vote in the following ways:</p>
<p>BY TELEPHONE</p>
<p>You can vote by calling the number<br>on your proxy card or voting<br>instruction form or provided on the<br>website listed on your notice.</p>
<p>BY MAIL</p>
<p>If you received written materials,<br>you can vote by mail by marking,<br>dating and signing your proxy card<br>or voting instruction form and<br>returning it in the envelope<br>provided.</p>
<p>AT THE MEETING</p>
<p>You can vote in person at the<br>Annual Meeting. If you hold your<br>shares in street name, you must<br>obtain a proxy from the record<br>holder to vote in person.</p>
<p>ONLINE</p>
<p>You can vote online at<br>proxyvote.com.</p>
<p>For telephone and online voting, you will need the 16-digit control number included on your notice, on your proxy card or in the voting<br>instructions that accompanied your proxy materials. Telephone and online voting are available through 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on<br>April 27, 2023, for shares held in employee plans, and through 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 1, 2023, for all other shares.</p>
<h26>Confidential Voting</h26><p>We maintain the confidentiality of the votes of individual shareholders. Your vote will not be disclosed unless the law requires<br>disclosure, you authorize disclosure or your vote is cast in a contested election. If you write comments on your proxy card,<br>management may learn how you voted in reviewing your comments. In addition, the Inspectors of Election and selected employees of<br>our independent tabulating agent may have access to individual votes in the normal course of counting and verifying the vote.</p>
<h26>Effect of Not Casting Your Vote</h26><p>If you hold your shares in street name, you must instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares. Under NYSE<br>rules, brokers are permitted to exercise discretionary voting authority on “routine” matters when voting instructions have not been<br>received from a beneficial owner ten days prior to the shareholder meeting. The only “routine” item on this year’s Annual Meeting<br>Agenda is Item 2 (Ratification of Appointment of the Company’s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm).<br>Therefore, if you hold your shares in street name and you wish to have your shares voted on all items in this Proxy Statement, please<br>return your voting instruction form or cast your instructions by telephone or online. Otherwise, your shares will not be voted on any<br>items with the exception that your broker may vote in its discretion on Item 2.</p>
<h26>Revocation of Proxies</h26><p>You can revoke your proxy at any time before your shares are voted if you:</p>
<h31>▪ Submit a written revocation to our Company’s Corporate Secretary and Chief Governance Officer;</h31><h31>▪ Submit a later-dated proxy;</h31><h31>▪ Provide subsequent telephone or online voting instructions; or</h31><h31>▪ Vote at the meeting.</h31><p>If you hold your shares in street name, please follow the directions provided to you by your bank, broker or other intermediary to<br>change or revoke any voting instructions you have already provided.</p>

<h29> 102 2023 PROXY STATEMENT</h29><h26>Quorum and Required Vote</h26><p>We will have a quorum and will be able to conduct the business of the annual meeting if the holders of a majority of the votes that<br>shareholders are entitled to cast are present at the meeting or by proxy. For the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, to elect<br>directors and adopt the other proposals, the following votes are required under our governing documents and New York State law:</p>
<p>Item Vote Required</p>
<p>Do abstentions</p>
<p>count as</p>
<p>votes cast?</p>
<p>Is broker</p>
<p>discretionary</p>
<p>voting allowed?*</p>
<p>Election of directors</p>
<p>Approval of the majority of the votes cast No No</p>
<p>Ratification of appointment of independent<br>registered public accounting firm</p>
<p>Approval of the majority of the votes cast No Yes</p>
<p>Advisory resolution to approve executive<br>compensation**</p>
<p>Approval of the majority of the votes cast No No</p>
<p>Say-on-Pay Frequency**</p>
<p>Approval of the majority of the votes cast No No</p>
<p>Shareholder proposals**</p>
<p>Approval of the majority of the votes cast No No</p>
<p>* A broker non-vote occurs when a broker submits a proxy but does not vote for an item because it is not a “routine” item and the broker has not received voting</p>
<p>instructions from the beneficial owner. As described under Effect of Not Casting Your Vote, your broker may vote in its discretion only on Item 2, Ratification of<br>Appointment of the Company’s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.</p>
<p>** Advisory/Non-binding</p>
<p>There are no cumulative voting rights. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered as votes cast and will have no effect on<br>the outcome of the vote on any of the proposals. If any other matter comes before the meeting, the named proxies will use their best<br>judgment in voting the proxies.</p>
<h20>Multiple Shareholders Sharing the Same Address</h20><p>We are sending only one notice or one Proxy Statement and Annual Report to the address of multiple shareholders unless we have<br>received contrary instructions from any shareholder at that address. This practice, known as “householding,” reduces duplicate<br>mailings, saving paper and reducing printing costs. If any shareholder residing at such an address wishes to receive an individual<br>copy of the materials, or if you are receiving multiple copies of our Proxy Statement and Annual Report and would like to enroll in this<br>service, please contact the Company’s Corporate Secretary and Chief Governance Officer (see page 103 for contact information).</p>

Any such proposals must comply with all of the requirements of SEC Rule 14a-8.</p>
<h26>Other Shareholder Proposals for Presentation at the 2024 Annual Meeting</h26><p>Under our bylaws, shareholders must follow certain advance notice procedures to nominate a person for election as a director at an<br>annual or special meeting, or to introduce an item of business at an annual meeting. Under these advance notice procedures,<br>shareholders must submit the proposed nominee or item of business by delivering a notice to the Corporate Secretary and Chief<br>Governance Officer at our principal executive offices. We must receive notice as follows:</p>

<h31>▪ Alternatively, if we hold the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on a date that is not within 25 days before or after such</h31><p>anniversary date, we must receive the notice no later than ten days after the earlier of the date we first provide notice of the<br>meeting to shareholders or announce it publicly.</p>
